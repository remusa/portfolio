true tribalism — a commitment to one group of people above and potentially at the expense of all others — remains deeply taboo.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 25-26
One must never cheer too loudly or fight too hard. It’s all a game, and you have to be able to hug it out after the final scores are tallied. Even war is just “winning hearts and minds.”
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 28-29
Today, all good, modern, civilized men living in the Western world are all taught to be good global citizens whose racial, cultural and religious loyalties must always be subordinate to a broader and more inclusive commitment to the human race. To say that you care about one group of people more than others is a moral sin in the modern world. It is considered uncivilized — barbaric.

Masculinity is tragic. Masculinity is a lifelong struggle, a gauntlet run against nature and other men to demonstrate virility and prove one’s worthiness as a man in the eyes of other men. Masculinity is a challenge to honor that ends only in death — a challenge to win coupled with a guarantee that, eventually, even the best men will lose. Masculinity means being born a boy who can only become a man by becoming stronger, by overcoming fearfulness, by becoming more competent and confident in his abilities, and by earning the respect and admiration of other males. Every boy is born cursed. Every boy will be tried and measured against others and he soon perceives or understands instinctively — he soon knows that the way of men is the way of competition and strife.

The way to manhood is through the gauntlet, and there is no end to it. Manhood is not a destination but a title to be defended.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 57-64
The idea that a man should be “secure in his masculinity” is a bourgeois fantasy invented by therapists and repeated by women. Every king, every chief, every world record holder and every silverback gorilla looks over his shoulder. Being good at being a man just means the challenges get dialed up and the challengers become more formidable.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 65-67
This gauntlet must be run whether a boy likes it or not, whether he accepts it or rejects it. To reject the struggle is forfeiture. Avoiding the struggle is an acceptance of defeat and a demonstration of spiritual cowardice.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 67-69
There are some who will applaud this kind of forfeiture as if it were courageous, but they are despisers of masculinity and strength. They are foolish women or failed men or deceitful manipulators who prefer men to be passive, for reasons of their own.

Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 71-72
accepting the fate of men and running the gauntlet of manliness means understanding that the fight is never truly fair, and that all men are not born with the same strengths.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 71-72
Accepting the fate of men also means understanding that the fight is rigged, and that every man will either die early or live to see himself decline. Every man who does not die in his prime will live to see his body fail and become weaker, making him more reticent. Most men will live to see their father’s

Accepting the fate of men also means understanding that the fight is rigged, and that every man will either die early or live to see himself decline. Every man who does not die in his prime will live to see his body fail and become weaker, making him more reticent. Most men will live to see their father’s competence falter, then their own competence falter, and they will live to see themselves lose the esteem of men. The best an older man can hope for is to have his achievements remembered, and to be respected for his wisdom and consulted for his experience.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 73-76
Understanding masculinity means understanding that men can only reach their greatest potential through vital conflict and competition with other men.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 77-78
Understanding masculinity means understanding that men can only reach their greatest potential through vital conflict and competition with other men. The way of men is the way of the pack hunt, and man is the most dangerous game. Human masculinity is the evolutionary product of gang selection — of bands of men who hunted and fought their way through far more perilous and demanding ages.

The way of men is the way of the pack hunt, and man is the most dangerous game. Human masculinity is the evolutionary product of gang selection — of bands of men who hunted and fought their way through far more perilous and demanding ages. Human masculinity — the testing and proving of strength, courage, mastery and the desire to earn the respect of a given group of men — requires conflict to thrive, but also to survive. Eternal peace is the death of manliness. The peace sign is a death rune.

Strength can only be tested against resistance and courage can only be tested through risk. Competence matters most when it is most desperately needed.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 83-84
Strength can only be tested against resistance and courage can only be tested through risk. Competence matters most when it is most desperately needed. Honor requires an honor group — a finite group of men to stand in judgement of each other’s virtues. No man can prove himself to every man, everywhere, and the expectation that men should have to prove themselves to every man and woman creates a sense of futility.

Honor requires an honor group — a finite group of men to stand in judgement of each other’s virtues. No man can prove himself to every man, everywhere, and the expectation that men should have to prove themselves to every man and woman creates a sense of futility. If the number of judges and challengers is infinite, why bother? If every man is both a brother and a potential threat, who do you fight for? Who do you become the strongest and most courageous and most competent version of yourself for?

How much can any one man’s honor matter when he must answer to and be compared to billions of other men, of other strangers who do not and cannot care what he does or how he lives or whether he lives or dies? A man and his honor get lost among the numberless hordes. Because a man cannot be accountable to everyone, without an honor group — without a tribe — he is accountable only to his own ego.

Most religions defer the final assessment
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 91-91
Most religions defer the final assessment of a man’s deeds to the gods, but the judgment of the gods is far-too-conveniently post-mortem. Brothers judge you to your face, in the here and now.

Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 91-93
Men all around the world and throughout history have shared the fate of men. In every dominant culture known, men have pushed each other to be stronger, more courageous and more competent. They have tested each other and shamed or expelled men who refused to be tested, who made them look weaker as a group. Manhood has always been demanding, it has always been a trail that ends only in death, and it has always been tragic.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 93-96
masculinity is a human universal — something that all men have in common — but universalism destroys masculinity. Without separation there can be no conflict and without conflict there can be no vital masculinity. To say that you love every man as your brother is not only a lie, but a resignation to impotence and a forfeiture of manhood.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 96-99
many enemies bring much honor, and it is also true that without enemies, there can be no honor. Without outsiders, there can be no insiders. Without “them,” there can be no “us.” Without “us,” there can be no honor group, and therefore, no honor.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 99-101
The experience of being a man is something all men have in common, an experience shared and understood by friends and enemies alike, but the very nature of masculinity demands that we go to our corners and fight it out.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 101-103
All of our life stories are a collection of highs and lows, of victories and defeats, of struggles and of overcoming.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 105-105
All of our life stories are a collection of highs and lows, of victories and defeats, of struggles and of overcoming. Without conflict, no life story is worth telling. Without conflict and struggle, the answer to the question “What happened?” is: “Nothing.”
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 105-106
Like Odin and Thor, we know we will die, but unless we fight, we are already as good as dead.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 107-107
Better to live vigorously, better to fight, than to simply wait for the end...in peace.

It has always been the way of men to identify a group of friends, allies and kin, to draw a perimeter around them, to fight to protect them and to advance their interests.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 113-114
The absence of social identity — of belonging to any clearly defined group — conjures the Hobbesian fantasy of the warre of “all against all” where men are friendless and every man and woman and child is a potential enemy. This friendless, low-trust world is chaotic, inhuman and temporary.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 114-116
Order demands violence, but the drive to order is the product of identity. Whether it is a matter of “us” deciding how to proceed or “us” deciding how to control “them,” order cannot be established or maintained without collective coercive actions.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 122-123
Order demands violence, but the drive to order is the product of identity. Whether it is a matter of “us” deciding how to proceed or “us” deciding how to control “them,” order cannot be established or maintained without collective coercive actions. Ordered violence is violence coordinated by allies — the opposite of the chaotic melee of every man fighting against every man.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 122-124
alliances are the root of collective identity, and over time any group of “us” will develop its own internal culture
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 125-125
cultures are the product of separateness and discrimination. They can only flourish and be maintained so long as the boundaries between insiders and outsiders are observed and preserved.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 127-129
Men who have no collective identity — who have no strong alliances or sense of belonging in a particular ingroup — are wanderers dependent on a larger system that rules from above. Humans are social animals. The loner who wants to be alone is an anomalous deviation — however romantic the brooding archetype of the wandering individualist may be. The loner is essentially missing half of his identity.

Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 129-132
This free-floating state of chaos makes humans nervous, so they frantically adopt symbols that identify them with some group of people — however superficial, transient or inconsequential that group may in fact be.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 132-134
This desperation is exploited by bourgeois consumer culture, which encourages people to identify and arrange themselves according to their entertainment preferences, hobbies or other purchase patterns.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 134-135
Consumer identities are disposable, superficial and subject to changes in fashion or circumstances. Ultimately, they prove unsatisfying, because an identity that can be easily shrugged off or replaced, or which can coexist with competing or conflicting identities fails to stabilize the self-image after its initial novelty has worn off. This creates an endless restlessness that drives the market for new consumer identities and more loose affiliations. These lightweight, shifting connections always leave enough emptiness for that nagging, navel-gazing question pondered by the lonely, spoiled cosmopolitan mind: “Who am I?”
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 135-140
A man who has earned his place in a group of men knows who he is. A man who knows who his “we” is doesn’t have to wonder “who he is.” He doesn’t have to meditate on every dendrite of his own spiritual snowflake to “find himself.” He doesn’t have to find himself because he knows where he belongs. His personal identity is located within and relates to his social identity. His idea of himself is not a daydream or a whim, it is repeatedly verified and peer-reviewed. His ego is balanced by his superego.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 140-144
Social identity is meaning. It is the “why” that follows naturally from the “we.”
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 146-146
Social identity is meaning. It is the “why” that follows naturally from the “we.” Without a firm social context, humans are disoriented and actions become relatively arbitrary and meaningless. Social identity is social orientation. It is the starting point from which the spear extends.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 146-148
Identity is a rootedness that provides a rationale for action. Identity is everything and everyone inside the perimeter. It is the superego that gives context to the ego, the natural home of the ego — the home of the self. Essentially, tribal identity is everything that matters.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 148-151
If tribal identity is everything that matters, then, in the absence of tribal identity, nothing really matters. There is only chaos and disorientation, confusion and anxiety, arbitrariness of action and a rootless emptiness.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 152-154
Modern Western governments and corporations — a synergistic collaboration of independently operating international self-interested entities which I’ll collectively call “The Empire of Nothing” — are concerned primarily with facilitating global trade, so it is pragmatic for them to encourage moral universalism. By moral universalism, I mean applying the same moral principles to everyone, everywhere and treating everyone as part of the same ingroup.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 154-157
Any vestigial sense of social identity still present in Western men, any desire to observe and maintain social boundaries or protect perimeters, is highly discouraged by Western governments and corporate cultures alike. Racial identity, religious identity, nationalism and even sexual identity are becoming increasingly taboo among Western white men.

Any vestigial sense of social identity still present in Western men, any desire to observe and maintain social boundaries or protect perimeters, is highly discouraged by Western governments and corporate cultures alike. Racial identity, religious identity, nationalism and even sexual identity are becoming increasingly taboo among Western white men. Good, modern, civilized white men are expected to purge from their hearts and minds any trace of natural human tribalism that might prevent any people from feeling uncomfortable within the Empire.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 161-165
Despite the heavy-handed subterfuges of “multiculturalism” and “diversity is our strength,” the underlying reality is that within a few generations, any living culture will dissolve into an innocuous and half-remembered “cultural heritage” and the descendants of separate and even intransigent groups will become interchangeable consumers, voters and employees. If they don’t, they’ll end up prisoners, and that also suits the Empire of Nothing.

To any man’s mind, even one billion people might as well be an infinite number of people. The human mind cannot meaningfully conceptualize that many upright monkeys. It’s just a number. If you started writing down the names of these people — which are nearly meaningless tags for entire lifetimes of human thought and experience — at an average rate of 6 seconds per name, without breaks or sleep, it would take you 190 years or so to write down one billion names. You wouldn’t know anything about those people, you wouldn’t remember more than a few of those names,

What it actually means to care about everyone on the planet is so far beyond the processing power of the human brain that you might as well be talking about perceiving eternity or infinite space or any other concept we can really only talk about in completely abstract and theoretical terms. To perceive oneself in the context of billions of people, and I imagine this is a guilty pleasure especially among elites and others who think very highly of themselves, you must step back and over the world and see people as mere trends, percentages, swarms of microscopic organisms invisible to the naked eye.

If you prefer to despair, attempt to imagine yourself and the meaning of your life in the context of just a billion people and caring about them all equally. It is as disorienting as floating alone in space. Universal humanity is so much of something that it’s nothing. Placing yourself among billions is like setting your soul adrift in the void. To be one with billions isn’t “enlightenment,” it’s self-negation. It’s inhuman. Total unity is total death.

let’s say you are a good, modern, civilized man who is fully invested in the globalist project of eradicating social injustice, racism, sexism, classism. You’re committed to treating every other human like family. You’re going to apply functional tribal ideals, like The Golden Rule, to everyone you meet. You’re going to assume that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and you are going to treat them as you’d want to be treated. You’re going to ignore stereotypes — which are informational profiles of groups of people that may or may not be accurate at the individual level — and treat everyone else as if they are in your group and have the same basic “human” values.

Researchers say that the human brain can only maintain meaningful relationships
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 205-206
Researchers say that the human brain can only maintain meaningful relationships with about 150-250 people at a given time, depending on what kind of relationship you consider meaningful. You can’t possibly know more people than that well enough to trust them. Everyone else is a stranger. Now, within a homogenous cultural group where social codes and values are normalized, you can probably afford to treat most people the way you’d want to be treated, because they are theoretically playing by the same rules. However it still makes good sense to be careful when you deal with strangers, and if your mother cared about you at all, she already taught you that.

Part of the purpose of wearing religious garb is to identify members and separate them from strangers. When someone wears special headgear or a special outfit for their religion, part of what they are doing is signalling that they are part of another group, a subculture within or separate from your group. They are sending a message that they have different values from you and that they care about enough adhering to the codes of their ingroup and maintaining a boundary between insiders and outsiders that they are willing to risk your suspicion.

in pluralistic Western democracies, men are taught that is morally wrong to judge a book by its cover. Men are taught that it is wrong to make snap judgements and that they should assume the best case scenario instead of making decisions based on the worst case scenario. Even when someone says outright in plain language that they are not on your team and are actually working against you, you will be warned about jumping to conclusions and stereotyping.

“Fuck Whitey” We should listen to what he has to say and try to understand his experience. “Fuck the Police” He’s probably responding to unfair racial profiling and economic injustice. “Allahu Akbar!” [BOOM!] Perhaps we’ve offended him.

In practice, moral universalism — often perversely called “humanism” — has become a secular catechism of self-denial and spiritual surrender. Like religious penitents, universalists flail and torment themselves for even having improper or unkind thoughts about their fellow human beings. And like inquisitors, their righteousness drives them to rout or ruin any heretic who dares to speak his sinful thoughts aloud.

Success in a given situation depends on observing it as clearly and accurately as possible, orienting yourself within that situation, making a decision about how to proceed based on that data, executing that plan, and then returning to the beginning of the loop to re-assess the situation as it unfolds.

If a man held up his fist and said he was going to punch you, and you simply refused to believe it, your belief alone wouldn’t change his intent. If he decided to punch you, your belief alone wouldn’t prevent his fist from hitting your face.

If he decided to punch you, your belief alone wouldn’t prevent his fist from hitting your face.

If he decided to punch you, your belief alone wouldn’t prevent his fist from hitting your face. Anyone watching would think you were either blind or dumb for being unable to accurately observe the unfolding circumstances and the information being provided to you.

Because you believed the man would not hit you, you made the decision not to act, and relied on your mistaken belief instead of protecting yourself. Refusing to interpret threats or any information accurately because you don’t want to believe it is obviously foolish. But Western men are expected to act like fools.

Good, modern, civilized Western white men are so easily cowed by charges of bias and privilege that they work tirelessly to outdo each other with social displays of moral universalism — by cucking themselves in every way imaginable.

When Western men recognize that they have an advantage or someone accuses one of them of some real or imagined “privilege,” they’re expected to acknowledge it and step aside or handicap themselves in some perverse Harrison Bergeron fashion to make things more “equal” and “fair” for everyone else — as if life has ever been or ever could be fair, as if people had ever been or could be truly equal.

Moral universalism is a philosophy for men who have surrendered. They have surrendered their land, their history, their women, their dignity and their identity. They’ve become impotent half-men who deserve to be victims and slaves. Moral universalism is a poisonous, emasculating philosophy for any man who adopts it. If you are not a Western white man, and you adopt this philosophy, you will also eventually lose your culture and your history and your identity and you will also deserve to be a victim and a slave. Your cappuccino-colored kin will disappear completely into that incomprehensible swarm of 9.5 billion indistinguishable cappuccino-colored drones.

The interests and mechanisms that drive the Empire have no use for identity. Identity is an inconvenience. It’s inefficient. It’s in the way. The forces of globalism are aligned against identity, against everything that means anything. Together, they form an Empire of Nothing.

It is often said that the problem the Romans had with Christians was that they refused to worship the Roman gods. Essentially, they refused to accept Roman identity. Christians wanted to maintain their own identity, and it was everything to them. The Romans knew that identity was everything, that social order was the product of shared identity, and that tolerating the rejection of their centralized, homogenizing identity would be inviting a slow rot to gnaw away at everything they created and cared about.

As demographics in America have changed, the big studios have rushed to include actors that reflect those demographics. There is no cultural hegemony emanating from a particular people with a particular identity, merely a profit-driven system of production that responds to changes in the market, with the aim of reaching the most consumers possible. The only culture being imposed through this mechanism is anti-culture — moral and cultural universalism that dissolves social boundaries to make the maximum number of consumers feel included.

until recently, nations remained nations. They were nations of place, language, religion and race. People living in different nations developed and maintained distinctly different cultures. People believed different things and incompatible religious groups fought turf wars. The sexes had different social roles. People had ethic roots that they were willing to fight for. They weren’t so quick to trade away their ethnic identities and the identities of their ancestors to disappear into “the future”... into the vagueness of “progress.”

religions have rules. Religions have ideals. Religions that claim to be the best way, the true way, and the only right way for all men and women all around the world must punish, shun or exclude those who behave the wrong way. Every right way is defined against its opposite. Piety and right-living are contrasted against heresy and sin. Even this has become inconvenient.

passionate moral condemnation and public shaming are now reserved for racists, sexists, religious “extremists” and all of the phobes: homophobes, xenophobes, transphobes, Islamophobes and and anyone else who limits or excludes or defines by separating or distinguishing. This tactic of associating all non-universalist moralities with fear is itself a shrewd subversion of male honor. By equating any discriminatory position with cowardice, lonely male consumers without the sense of identity and belonging that comes from a strong group of bonded male peers can be easily manipulated by their natural desire to avoid association with groups of men who are socially recognized as cowards.

Throughout history one of the most consistent strategies employed to unify patrimonial groups into tribes, kingdoms and nations has been the discovery or manufacture of a mythical common ancestor. Today, modern genetic and evolutionary studies are frequently employed in the service of global unity to show that all humans have common ancestors, even if their ancestral groups separated millions of years ago and the relevance of common ancestry is questionable.

Women, especially high status women, have always exerted political influence through their men. For instance, throughout the Icelandic sagas and other Germanic literature, one learns again and again that if you anger the queen, she will use her influence over the king and his men to make you pay for it. However, after women were given a formal and equal vote in democratic societies, their natural tendencies to nurture, comfort, and include quickly corroded the cultural structures of those societies both internally and externally.

Women have always excelled at teaching and enforcing everyday etiquette. Within a given tribe, this has always been a necessary and important role that promotes internal unity and harmony.

The People of the Empire have been convinced that they are free. They are free to do anything but leave the Mother’s womb, to distinguish and separate themselves from The Empire — to be born.

The People of the Empire have been convinced that freedom is a synonym for permission. They believe they are free because they’ve won the permission to smoke marijuana in their own homes, marry a person of the same sex, or to change their sex altogether if they don’t like being a male or a female. They believe that they are free because they are permitted to purchase permits to buy handguns or build houses. The People of the Empire believe they are free because they are allowed to vote and officially register their opinions. They are even permitted to protest — peacefully.

When men fight for freedom, they aren’t fighting for permission. When men fight for freedom, they are fighting for independence and self-determination. Except in the case of slave revolts, they are fighting for collective determination. When free men fight together for freedom, they are fighting for separation to establish a new collective identity. They are fighting to distinguish a new “us” from an old “us” which has become a tyrannical “them.” They are drawing a new perimeter and establishing a new order.

Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 536-537
For the average man, this means progressive emasculation as well as the elimination and stigmatization of male-only groups of any kind. It means a monoculture of everything for everyone. It means the abandonment of sincere religion, and eventually of all racial, ethnic and sexual identity. The model citizen of The Empire of Nothing is a citizen of the Empire — of the World — first and foremost. All other residual, subcultural and consumer identities must remain subordinate to the identity of World Citizen and Consumer.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 536-539
Any identity that supersedes the identity of World Citizen is a revolt against the Empire and a motion toward freedom — toward traumatic separation from the Mother of Exiles and birth into the world.

The only way to gain freedom from the Empire is to undermine that narrative with counter-narratives. To create alternative stories and identities. The meat grinder of universal togetherness can only be opposed by tribal separateness. Not mere subcultures, but tribes of people with exclusive identities who resist assimilation and exist as independently as possible. Tribes of people who are truly connected, and who are more loyal to each other than they are to the Empire. Tribes of people who are willing to build social barriers and nurture cultures and values that are distinctly separate from the culture and values of the Empire.

humans naturally want to belong to a group. They are hungry for identity, because identity is meaning, identity is order — identity is everything. The Empire sells superficial identities that are fleeting, synthetic, empty and unsatisfying. In a world of single, spoiled boys who have been able to walk away from any commitment or association — lifetime brotherhood is a radical idea. Collective honor is a radical idea. Working to help people you know and care about instead of strangers is a radical idea.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 558-561
These ideas are radical in that they are at odds with the social agenda of The Empire, but they are appealing because they are also ancient, profound and fundamentally human. The word radical itself comes from the Latin word for root. Tribalism is the root of human culture.

Men everywhere yearn for the collapse of this current mode of civilization that, as an inevitable consequence of its design, must devalue and emasculate them.

The word barbarian comes to us from the Greeks, who regarded non-Greeks — those who babbled in their own foreign tongues or who spoke Greek badly — with civilized contempt. It doesn’t describe a particular people. A barbarian is an outsider, someone with a separate culture who is not part of the state or polis. The word barbarian is evidence of the Greeks thinking tribally. They weren’t afraid to separate “us” (meaning: “us Greeks”) from “them” (meaning: “Who cares? They aren’t even Greek!”).

Flag-wavers often say, “If you don’t like my country, then leave.” But there is nowhere to go. There is no escape. There are no more New Worlds, no readily habitable and fertile uncharted lands to discover. The reach of commercialism and its universalist monoculture is always expanding, even into unstable and untamed zones like Africa or Afghanistan, and it will keep expanding until there is a McDonalds in every Mosque and the world’s most volatile religion is moderated into another meaningless consumer identity. You could spend all of your resources and the best years of your life trying to fuck off to some rugged oasis, only to find a few years later that Globocorp will be bulldozing your eden to make room for chain stores and condominiums.

Men who were born within the pegged together particle board and plastic Empire are not and cannot become blissfully ignorant bug and banana eaters. Almost all men are products of the Empire, born in concrete hospitals and brought up gobbling processed sugar snacks while kept busy with cartoons. All they have is a dream of a different life and a sense that everything worth having is being systematically snuffed out to make way for more weakness and empty greed and semi-solitary sloth. Men born into the Empire cannot go back and be born barbarians or run away to some magical place to become barbarians. The only way to become barbarians today is to create that magical place inside the Empire, hollow out little pockets inside of it and become outsiders who undermine the Empire within its borders.

To be a barbarian today is to draw your own perimeter and build social networks and reciprocal relationships that are not dictated or controlled by the Empire. It means drawing in the boundaries of your “we” so that you know exactly who your people are, who you can depend on, who cares about what happens to you, who you are obligated to, and where your loyalties lie. It’s easy to say that you “belong” to big, abstract groups of strangers who demand nothing of you. Becoming a barbarian — becoming the kind of man who can belong to a tribe — requires a level of commitment that makes “good, modern, civilized men” uncomfortable.

Hail the rugged individualist! You are both a man and an island, a lonely lighthouse standing boldly and brightly shining your skeptic’s light of objective truth over the murky sea of uncertainty and confusion. You wouldn’t join any club that would have you as a member — which is just your smug, jokey way of saying you think groups are for suckers and you are far too smart to lose yourself in the snake-handling, sig-heiling, hymn-singing madness of crowds.

Western men are in love with the Hobbesian fallacy that the natural state and truest form of man is a man alone, fiercely independent, and at war with the world. They are in love with the idea of being ronin armed with reason, masterless men doing battle against falsehood, true only to their own personal sense of honor and somehow too pure to be corrupted by involvement with “group-thinkers.” The Hollywood ideal is the damaged do-gooder, a tumbleweed of restless violence and God’s Own Truth blowing from storyline to storyline, refusing or botching all franchise-endangering attachments. The popularity of the do-right drifter endures because he both captures and romanticizes the isolation of a man lost in the scale of modern social organization. In this narcissistic fantasy, modern men can attribute a moral nobility to what is, for all but a few, complete statistical irrelevance and state-sponsored separation from groups of men unsupervised by women or bureaucratic functionaries.

We are constantly reassured that “one person can really make a difference” precisely because the opposite is true. Maybe one person with a billion dollars, but not just one person. The lone wolf can snarl and snap at the heels of the governments and corporations, but he is always dismissed by the powers that be as a friendless nut-job — a true individualist!

The best men are not loners, they are leaders. The best men, the greatest exemplars of virility, are not the spoiled, decadent inheritors of crowns and laurels — they are the men who earn the respect, trust and admiration of other men in their own lifetimes. Men who do not lead are not empowered by always going it alone. They become the best, most powerful versions of themselves by working in concert with other men, bringing everything they have and using it to accomplish more than they could accomplish by themselves.

As these institutions expand and become ever more inclusive, his influence becomes even less powerful. In a sea of billions, a man alone is plankton.

Psychoanalysts sometimes use an iceberg as a model for the psyche. Our conscious selves are the tip of the iceberg that sticks out of the water. This protruding portion of the iceberg is made up of of our ego, what we think of as our rational mind and free will, along with a greater or lesser part of our superego, which includes our cultural training, morality and biases. Below the water lies the subconscious portion of the ego, most of the superego, and the weighty mass of the Id, made up of our primal drives. The Id is basic human nature.

The individualist has a religious devotion to his ego, and he strives to purify and protect it from the external influences that form the superego. The intellectual gunslinger, the lonely lighthouse is his self-schema — his romantic idea of himself. He will defend this idea of himself against the reality that the ego-worship of the individual and his “natural rights” has actually been the dominant cultural narrative in Western nations for two or three hundred years, and can be traced all the way back to Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am.” It is actually his superego, his training in cultural norms, as much as anything else, that tells him his ego is his greatest treasure. The individualist is terrified that his iceberg will sink, that he will become unconscious and lose his ego — himself — in the madness of the crowd, in the orgies of Id sanctioned by the superego.

The modern individualist — egoist, even — usually still talks about what everyone else talks about when they are talking about it, operates within a comfort zone of social norms and lives by himself in a way that is generally acceptable to what he calls, usually with some derision, “the herd.” At his most individualistic, he is a troll, a heckler, a parasite. A troll can’t be trusted, and should always be shunned and despised, even though it will only feed into his self-schema. At his least individualistic, the modern individualist becomes special just like everyone else. The familiar example is kids who are “trying to find themselves,” who get involved in some “rebellious” subculture that has been carefully marketed to them, and spend their time and money hard signalling their belonging in some “individualistic” group. The adult individualist laughs at the hard-signalling teen from the comfort of his career khakis and settled life, but he is probably even less of an individual, and probably lonelier and less connected to anything.

The individualist protects himself from what he perceives as the unconsciousness of group-think, but by protecting himself from the dynamic judgment of the group, he also protects his ego from the truth and objectivity he claims to seek. He limits his development as a man, because man is not and has never been a solitary animal. The way of men has always been the way of the gang, and it is just as easy for him to delude himself about who and what he is alone as it is when running with a pack. Isn’t it possible that a man knows less about himself when he protects himself like a rare zoological specimen, compared to the man who has observed himself in the wild, in the social formation that is most natural to his species? How mighty any caged ape seems, but his solitude prevents him from becoming what he truly is.

Surely, men do not become thoughtless zombies when they commit themselves to a group. Men in a tribe may participate in actions initiated by the group which they would not have initiated on their own, which they may or may not agree with completely, but as members of the tribe, like members of any functioning group of humans, they trade some free will for tangible and intangible benefits offered by the group. Every so-called individualist already does this, both by choice and in response to the coercive force of the state.

Men are always submitting to something or someone, whether in a gang or at work or to live in a nation of millions. It is the way of men to avoid being perceived as being overly submissive — we want to show strength and courage to each other and, tactically, to those who would threaten us. But every man either submits or compromises occasionally, or he dies very young. Submission is a normal and necessary feature of male psychology.

To become part of a tribe, you must be willing to let go of one version of yourself, one self-schema, and find another version of yourself within the context of the group. You must be willing to “lose yourself to find yourself.” You must be willing to go to sleep in a world of rules determined by the Empire and wake up in a world of rules determined by the tribe. You must be willing to give up the inconsequential individualism of the citizen of the world and become an individual member of a tribe in which all of your assets, actions and ideas have an exponentially greater chance of being influential. To leave the Empire behind and take on a tribal mind, you must choose to perceive that transformation not as an act of self-negation, but as a process of becoming and personal evolution.

The love of a man who is willing to discriminate, to separate “us” from “them,” has far greater value than the cheap sentiment of the man who says he loves all mankind. The love of a man who loves everyone and anyone is spread so thin it is weak and meaningless, but the love of man who discriminates is concentrated, powerful and profound. It gives him direction and purpose. Adopting a tribal mindset puts an end to meaningless, one-sided, fantasy relationships with strangers and devoting all of your love, caring, loyalty and protection to a few out of the many.

That starving kid in Africa with flies on his eyes is still a stranger in some foreign shithole you’ll never go to. He’s not your responsibility, and the only reason you even know about him is because some group of people who would rather help exotic strangers than their own neighbors want you to give them money to continue their elaborate, self-gratifying social display of moral purity.

Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 864-866
It is unlikely that you have power to significantly influence events in far-flung corners of the world or even down the block, so any emotional investment in political outcomes or the suffering of strangers overseas is a total waste of time, effort and energy that you could be investing in helping and building mutually beneficial relationships with people who you know, like or admire in your local area. Those investments are far more likely to yield a reciprocal return of love, caring, loyalty and even resources than investments in people you will never meet who live in places you will never go to.

Ask, “If I invested all of my time, energy and resources, up to and including my own life, to change this one thing, would it be reasonable for me to expect to alter the outcome of the situation?” If the reasonable answer is “no,” then surely your fickle, half-assed emoting about it is completely worthless.

You can either choose to float invertebrate along the media’s current and care about whoever the subjects of the Empire are caring about today, or choose to anchor your heart and mind to a select people and, like every comic book telepath, learn to tune out the cries of the multitude and focus your vitality on your people.

Giving everything to your own people, to your own tribe, means leaving nothing for strangers. You must harden your heart or be at the mercy of the many. This is not hate. This is selective love, and practiced indifference. Your heart is like your eyes. Everything is a blur until you focus.

Everyone has problems. Chose whose problems matter to you. When pressed to care about strangers, the maxim of the modern barbarian loose in the Empire is: “Not my people, not my problem.”

To men who have been enslaved by the universalist creed that proclaims every man a brother, turning a blind eye to suffering will seem callous and immoral. Treating some people differently than others will seem unfair. Feeling obliged to help everyone, everywhere and to treat them all equally is the impossible and immobilizing burden of the universalist man. Woe to him who tries to move with the weight of the whole world’s suffering on his back. To act, he must cheat and show preference, or do nothing at all — which is the only way he can truly treat everyone equally.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 885-889
It may be “barbaric,” to say that some people are more important to me than others, but it is far more honest than pretending I care about everyone equally. I don’t, and neither do you. To care about everyone equally is inhuman, even sociopathic.

Those who go out of their way to show how much they care about strangers usually pick unpopular groups or exotic minorities to demonstrate their commitment to moral purity and compete for higher moral status within a universalist system.

“Fairness” is conditional. There are different rules for different situations. There are different rules for friends and enemies, for outsiders and insiders. The so-called Golden Rule of “Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You” is another example of a moral code that is practical and unifying within a tribe, but invites disaster when applied to those who are not bound to each other, to enemies, or to those whose own moral codes are completely unknown.
Jack Donovan, Becoming a Barbarian, loc. 912-916
The Golden Rule works best in smaller, closed systems that share a common culture, while Caveat Emptor, Qui Bono, and “Do Unto Others As They Do Unto You” are far better mottoes for systems involving large, pluralistic groups of strangers.

When surrounded by strangers, while it is usually smart to be friendly, polite and easy to get along with to avoid unnecessary conflict and encourage similar behavior in others, adherence to The Golden Rule in matters of import with unknown individuals opens one up for easy exploitation. The Golden Rule is an excellent rule within a tribe and a foolish rule for dealing with the rest of the world. Codes prohibiting or controlling violence provide the most dramatic example.

The Golden Rule is an excellent rule within a tribe and a foolish rule for dealing with the rest of the world. Codes prohibiting or controlling violence provide the most dramatic example. It makes obvious strategic sense to punish people in a given tribe for maiming or murdering each other. Violence beyond the condoned and controlled violence of punishment or play spreads a sense of insecurity within the tribe, takes parents from their children, and by eliminating skilled individuals or able hands, may make the tribe weaker or less productive overall. The penalty for unsanctioned violence within the tribe must always be the threat of violence sanctioned by the group, because without any threat of violent reprisal, the strongest and most violent individuals could simply take whatever they wanted and kill anyone who disagreed, without any consideration for the survival or prosperity of the group as a whole. The tribe would collapse into chaos.

Those considered “barbarians” throughout history were not people without morality or codes of good and bad behavior. They were merely separate groups who took care of their own. Like all groups, including the “civilized” groups who called them barbarians, they were able to shift between different moral gears. They had one gear for insiders, and another gear for outsiders.

The barbarian spirit, is by contrast, and indeed in Nietzsche’s own words, maintained at the center of all the noblest, aristocratic-chivalric peoples, who base their value judgements on, “...a powerful physicality, a blossoming, rich, even effervescent good health that includes all of the things needed to maintain it, war, adventure, hunting, dancing, jousting and everything else that contains strong, free, happy action.” Barbarians are alive in the world and say “yes!” to life.

It seems likely that any functional group of humans would appreciate the value of charity, humility, sympathy and kindness when directed inward, to benefit “us.” Masculine thumos, that spiritedness that drives the guardians to protect and to fight injustice and disorder, seems almost impossible without some sense of sympathy or charity toward less able members of the tribe.

It is when the tactical virtues become subordinate to the “civilized” virtues in the cultural mainstream that a crippling, energy-sapping weakness overcomes a people and makes them easy to enslave with webs of petty rules and encourages submissive obsessions with comfort and etiquette. Theatrical gestures of kindness, charity and deference replace bold demonstrations of strength and courage, until legitimate strength and courage become morally suspect, and strength and courage must be charitably redefined to avoid hurting anyone’s feelings. This elevation of naturally subordinate virtues and the consequent failure of virility at least partially explain the mass delusion seen today, where combat veterans are called cowards while transsexuals and morbidly obese women who do nude photo spreads are applauded as heroes.

An attachment to these “nicer,” more sentimental virtues chains many otherwise virile men to a culture of weakness, and even motivates them to defend it, because they mistakenly view its abandonment as the abandonment of all that is good and decent in the world.

While the Empire of the slave-mind manufactures more and more weakness for them to protect, their charges are ingrates, and they become martyrs to an ideal respected by almost no one but those who have served in their own ranks. Their tactical virtues are employed not to defend fragile beauty, but to spread a corpulent culture of ressentiment, material greed, weakness and hideous degeneracy across the globe. Progressively, as threats to security wane, they will be turned on each other and their nobility will be wasted defending the newfangled “rights” of the worst and weakest people to become as grotesque as possible. These pig people of Bartertown, who shamelessly luxuriate in their own filth and want to be told they are special for doing it, make the perfect corporate consumers to feed the methane-fueled furnaces of the global economy.

Those who have drawn or accepted the boundaries of their moral responsibilities are not immoral, but they will necessarily have at least two moral gears. There is what is best for “us,” and what is good enough for “them” — there is a distinction between intra-tribal morality and inter-tribal morality. Intra-tribal morality concerns one’s moral responsibility to and within the tribe, for the good of the tribe. Inter-tribal morality concerns one tribe’s relationship with another tribe, and one’s moral responsibility to members of another tribe or to an outsider of unknown tribal affiliation. Humans have been operating this moral gear shift adeptly throughout human history. It isn’t inhuman — it’s exactly human.

There is what is best for “us,” and what is good enough for “them” — there is a distinction between intra-tribal morality and inter-tribal morality. Intra-tribal morality concerns one’s moral responsibility to and within the tribe, for the good of the tribe. Inter-tribal morality concerns one tribe’s relationship with another tribe, and one’s moral responsibility to members of another tribe or to an outsider of unknown tribal affiliation. Humans have been operating this moral gear shift adeptly throughout human history. It isn’t inhuman — it’s exactly human. It allows men to shift dynamically from caring loyally and consistently for those close to them to killing outsiders with no remorse when necessary. A commitment to treating everyone equally as if they were part of your tribe or family and assuming that they have made a similar commitment invites exploitation. It turns you into the naive country boy bound to get bamboozled in the big city. The universalist approach clouds perception, because humans don’t think or work that way. Strangers will generally favor their own interests and the interests of their people, no matter what they say. Watching what they do allows you to see the world clearly, and make the best decisions for yourself and your tribe. Trust you own. Take care of your own. Other people are weather and terrain. Adapt accordingly.

Why explain yourself to strangers — or worse — your enemies? Why try to convince them of anything? Why argue or debate with outsiders? What is to be gained from this kind of exchange? Offering an explanation for your words, thoughts or actions to outsiders or enemies is defensive, or at best, strategically passive-aggressive. Explaining or defending your actions, thoughts or words to your brothers or members of your tribe is a demonstration of loyalty and respect. If you have been accused of behaving badly, or in a manner inconsistent with your tribal culture, you explain and defend yourself because you want to remain a part of that tribe

If you have not been accused of any misdeed, but simply wish others in your tribe to consider a course of action at your recommendation, it is productive to defend and engage in a debate concerning the merits of your idea. Likewise, if you object to a suggested course of action, you show a man respect by hearing his idea and attempting to convince him that he is mistaken.

This manner of debate and argumentation is the habit, or at least the acknowledged ideal, of most Western men. It has a long tradition in the West, reaching back to the Classical era, and it is the style of argumentation we have all been taught and which is expected of us in any forum. It works, and the conventions of Western argumentation are productive — within a unified group or tribe. Like most Western conventions that survived because they were highly functional for smaller groups of men, civilized debate and argumentation leads to impotence, corruption and indecision when applied universally. It remains useful in the hard sciences, where proofs can be offered and examined objectively by anyone with the intelligence to comprehend and process the evidence and arguments being presented. However, Western-style debate and argumentation becomes wasteful and even harmful when its basic assumption — that everyone involved shares an identity, a common culture, and ultimately wants what is best for the group — is untrue.

This implied responsibility for a man to consider everyone, everywhere’s opinion and bring everyone, everywhere around to his opinion is illustrated millions of times every day all over the Internet and social media. Men engage in pointless and never-ending arguments with complete strangers — who are often anonymous and questionably sincere — as if they were their brothers, friends, or next-door neighbors. By involving himself in arguments with strangers, a man opens himself up to an infinite number of challenges from other men or women who then feel entitled to a response, as a tribal brother, friend or peer would rightfully feel entitled to a response.

The Barbarian refuses to accept everyone, everywhere as a member of his tribe. Because he is not blinded by a doctrine of infinite inclusiveness, he recognizes that others have interests and values that are irreconcilable with his own. He is beholden to a limited number of people — to “us” — and owes no explanation or justification to “them.” Contemplate the absurdity of a Viking explaining to monks why he is “right” to attack their monastery, or Attilla justifying his attacks on the Roman Empire to anyone but the Huns.

Another reason to engage in apologetics is to facilitate conversion. The evangelical Universalist must theoretically be willing to “share the good word” with everyone, everywhere, but the tribalist only seeks to convert or recruit desirable individuals — those whose conversion or recruitment would ultimately benefit the tribe or group in some way. The tribalist should be able to address the concerns of those interested in recruitment or conversion, and be able to distinguish what “we” believe or how “we” live from what “they” believe and how “they” live.

“...hunting and fighting are both of the same general character. Both are of a predatory nature; the warrior and the hunter alike reap where they have not strewn.

Barbarians say “yes” to life. They take what they want from the Empire and leave the rest to rot. They are alive without apology, bold and willing to fight for and seize what they want and what they need for them and theirs. Because anyone outside the tribe is no one to them, when they take, they take from no one. They will wear necklaces of your teeth — not to luxuriate in their own cruelty — but to celebrate their own victory over death, weakness and failure. Barbarians know that living is always taking. They have freed themselves from delusion and know who and what they are.

To take only what you need and share freely with others is a practical, mutually beneficial practice within a tribe of connected and interdependent people. Giving freely encourages goodwill and the return of favors. Relaxed deference to others in matters of no particular import — like holding a door open, for instance — demonstrates an easy vitality and strengthens social bonds. It acknowledges that, “we are all in this together.” However, in a world of strangers, there are no social bonds to strengthen. Men go through the motions of building community where no true community or cultural connectedness exists beyond something flimsy, like “we are humans who inhabit the same general geographical area.” Their good efforts are more often than not empty, wasted gestures.

The state — the Empire of Nothing — is essentially a collection of self-perpetuating bureaucratic organizations. The state sees you as a number, a demographic, a tax bracket, a potential violator of law to be dealt with “impartially.” To the politicians who direct the operations of the state you are a vote, a poll number, a donor — possibly even an enemy or a threat. In theory, the government of the United States of America exists to protect the bodies, rights and interests of American citizens. All 300 million or so of them. In reality, politicians legislate to protect their biggest donors, the special interest groups that get them elected, and people to whom they owe favors. The state itself may theoretically exist to protect national interests — the interests of its people as a whole — but the adoption of universalist morality has blurred the line between citizens of the state and “citizens of the world.” The US and the governments in Europe which are also stricken with universal morality have welcomed the export of jobs, the import of unskilled immigrants and hostile refugees, and they have engaged their citizens in costly foreign wars that offer little or no benefit or protection to average citizens.

A successful and respected man also helps carry the weight of some others. He doesn’t merely survive, he produces some kind of surplus, some kind of prosperity that can be shared by others within the perimeter of the group. He works to support not only himself, but the women and children and truly infirm or disabled. Every true leader of men I know feels a strong sense of responsibility to those who depend on the surplus he generates, and this sense of responsibility motivates him to work harder, to produce more and thereby increase prosperity and quality of life for his friends, his people, and his family. A good man in any tribe shares the bounty yielded by his strength. This desire to work to carry your own weight and help carry the weight of others is the vestige of functional intratribal morality.

In any functional tribe, every man should be expected to carry his own weight — at the very least. A successful and respected man also helps carry the weight of some others. He doesn’t merely survive, he produces some kind of surplus, some kind of prosperity that can be shared by others within the perimeter of the group.

Refusing to accept the abundance made available to you by states and corporations will not change the world. It will not change their policies and it will probably not influence any strangers to change their way of life. Some might argue that, “If everyone did [blank], then [blank] would happen.” But this is universalist thinking. You are not personally responsible for the actions of “everyone,” and your actions will probably not influence the actions of “everyone” in any measurable way.

Decide what values are important to you and your tribe and maintain them within the social perimeter of the group, but employ whatever means are necessary to ensure the tribe’s survival and prosperity in the context of the world as it exists in the present — not as you wish it to be in the future or imagine it was in the past.

No good, modern, civilized man wants to think of himself as a “criminal.” Most men see themselves as “good guys.” Men with a taste or talent for violence who want to be “good guys” often refer to themselves as “sheepdogs” — a metaphor popularized by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman in his book On Combat. According to Grossman, a sheepdog has a deep love for and fights to protect sheep, defined as “healthy, productive citizens” with “no capacity for violence,” from wolves, who have a capacity for violence but “no empathy for [their] fellow citizens.” Grossman diagnoses wolves as “aggressive sociopaths.”1 1 Grossman’s essay “On Sheep, Wolves and Sheepdogs” is currently available online at <http://killology.com/sheep_dog.htm>

Those who do become the state’s sheepdogs may never get a chance to tangle with wolves, but one of their primary purposes is to intimidate the sheep enough that they don’t become wolves. The qualities that differentiate “criminals” from “sheep” are not necessarily sociopathy or a propensity for violence, but impulse control and a rational fear of state authority. Most men recognize that executing “unauthorized violence” will result in them being designated as outlaws, hunted down by sheepdogs, threatened with state-authorized violence, and then either killed or imprisoned. The modern legal system didn’t evolve to protect innocent Hobbit-like sheeple from psycho-killer-wolves. It evolved in part to keep average men from killing each other over slights and getting involved in never-ending cycles of blood-feuds. The sheepdogs have permission to use violence to maintain the state’s monopoly on violence.

aren’t puppies and sheepdogs both a bit too cute? Perhaps even insulting? Would ancient warriors have wanted to be called “puppies” or “sheepdogs?” What is a sheepdog if not a domesticated wolf who, as the result of his breeding, training, and conditioning, does exactly what he is told? A sheepdog is a pet. A sheepdog has a master. His master owns him. The sheepdog’s master is not the sheep. His master uses the sheepdog to control the sheep, who are his assets with which he will do as he pleases.

If men are loyal to your tribe, and they are willing to maim and murder other men to protect you, why insult them by calling them slavish, domesticated pets? Why not call them your wolves? Don’t wolves defend their own pack? If you are fighting to protect people you care about — your people — then why fight like a sheepdog when you can fight like a wolf?

There are two ways to look at threats from outside the circle. You can accept them as challenges to be overcome and opportunities for greatness and glory — which is what Thor would do — or you can be low test about it and see it as evil meanies picking on you and your friends.

and outsiders — of “us” vs. “them.” One of the reasons that “good guys” don’t want to see themselves as wolves is that our ancestors saw wolves as wild, external forces of chaos. Wolves lived outside the enclosure of the town or village and preyed on lost, helpless and untended animals — and sometimes even humans. Little Red Riding Hood got eaten because she was tricked by an outsider, a wolf, who encouraged her to dawdle in the dark woods and wander off the path to grandmas on her way through the forest of the unknown. Wolves were devourers, always hungry. The wolves Sköll and Hati chased the sun and the moon across the sky, trying to swallow them. Even Odin himself was destined to be killed by the giant wolf Fenrir. But he was also associated with wolves, because hungry wolves are scavengers, like eagles, and after a battle they were often seen feasting on the corpses of the slain. To triumph in battle was to give one’s enemy to the wolves, and to prospect of defeat meant becoming food for the wolves and the eagles and the ravens.

The Romans referred to an outlaw who could be killed by anyone with impunity as homo sacer, meaning that as a man he was set apart. It is from the Latin sacer that we get the word “sacred,” but in this usage, it meant being set apart in the sense of being cursed. In Old Norse, the outlawed man was said to be “going to the forest,” or skóggangr. This idea persisted, and throughout the Middle Ages, a man who was outlawed was said to “wear the head of a wolf” — caput gerat lupinum. He was no longer a man, but a wolf who could be hunted

A man who has been convicted of breaking the law becomes a “criminal.” Everyone has broken some kind of law, and most people are breaking several at any given time, but what transforms the citizen into a criminal is getting caught. The people who were growing and dealing and smoking marijuana before it was legalized in some states and the people who are growing and dealing and smoking marijuana now in states where it hasn’t been legalized are or have been involved in criminal activity. They are or were technically criminals, but no one refers to them as criminals until they are legally charged with crimes. Everyone who has ever downloaded a song or a movie illegally has committed a crime. Men can drink and drive, snort coke, bootleg, beat their wives, gamble, hire prostitutes, sell guns, use fake IDs, write bad checks, cheat on taxes, beat each other up and straight-up murder motherfuckers...but no one calls them criminals until they get caught doing it. As Whitey Bulger says in the movie Black Mass (2015): “It’s not what you do, it’s when and where you do it. And who you do it to or with … If nobody sees it, it didn’t happen.” However, if and when someone does see it, and you get caught — if you are charged and convicted and especially if you go to prison — then you become a different kind of person. A man who breaks the law is just a man, but a man who gets caught and goes to prison — he’s a criminal. And, even after he has “done his time”... for many years afterward many people will refuse to hire him or rent to him. Most felons aren’t allowed to vote, and just about every “don’t tread on me,” “hands off my guns” Second Amendment activist and talk show host agrees that criminals should never have legal access to guns.

He may not be banished to the wilderness, and not just anyone is allowed to kill him or take his stuff, but he is not fully trusted. He is regarded as a potential force of chaos — wild, dangerous and unpredictable.

All kinds of men, even sheepdogs, commit crimes. There are all kind of different reasons why men commit crimes. Some men are certainly more inclined to break the law than others, and some men are more aggressive than others by nature. But a man is not a criminal until the government identifies him as a criminal, as a felon, as the lighter contemporary version of the man who wears the head of a wolf. Criminal is a designation of the state, not necessarily a type of person. By getting caught or openly breaking the laws of the state, he undermines order within the borders of the enclosure. Without violence, laws are just words, so anyone who has been designated a criminal will find himself an enemy of the state.

A criminal is regarded as a bad person, or different kind of person who must to a certain extent be dehumanized because people still allow the state to make moral determinations for them — as if modern governments represent the collective consensus of the people, the tribe, the village. The good, modern, civilized man doesn’t want to be considered a criminal, and he treats known criminals like different kinds of people — bad, evil, throwaway people — because his moral orientation includes the assumption or belief that criminals have broken “our law.”

Over the past century, as men came to grips with the decline of the West, their reaction has been one of hopelessness and despair. The word “occidental” is actually derived from a Latin root that means “to fall” as the sun falls in the West, and this Western sunset was always inevitable. While some sense of loss is understandable, ultimately this occidental melancholy is a testament only to lack of energy and imagination.
