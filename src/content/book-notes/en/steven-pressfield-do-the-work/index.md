Our Enemies The following is a list of the forces arrayed against us as artists and entrepreneurs: Resistance (i.e., fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism, etc.) Rational thought Friends and family
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 4, loc. 65-69
any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these acts will elicit Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 4, loc. 85-87
Resistance Is Invisible Resistance cannot be seen, heard, touched, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. Resistance is a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 88-91
Resistance Is Insidious Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that’s what it takes to deceive you. Resistance will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 91-97
Resistance Is Impersonal Resistance is not out to get you personally. It doesn’t know who you are and doesn’t care. Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively. Though it feels malevolent, Resistance in fact operates with the indifference of rain and transits the heavens by the same laws as stars.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 97-101
Resistance Is Infallible Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North—meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing. We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 101-6
Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 106-7
Resistance Never Sleeps Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance, even when he was seventy-five. In other words, fear doesn’t go away. The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 109-12
Resistance’s goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on this earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 114-17
Rational Thought Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneur’s worst enemy. Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego. Instead, we want to work from the Self, that is, from instinct and intuition, from the unconscious.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 117-21
Homer began both The Iliad and The Odyssey with a prayer to the Muse. The Greeks’ greatest poet understood that genius did not reside within his fallible, mortal self—but came to him instead from some source that he could neither command nor control, only invoke.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 121-23
Friends and Family The problem with friends and family is that they know us as we are. They are invested in maintaining us as we are. The last thing we want is to remain as we are.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 126-29
With some exceptions (God bless them), friends and family are the enemy of this unmanifested you, this unborn self, this future being. Prepare yourself to make new friends. They will appear, trust me.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 130-32
Our Allies Enough for now about the antagonists arrayed against us. Let’s consider the champions on our side: Stupidity Stubbornness Blind faith Passion Assistance (the opposite of Resistance) Friends and family
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 132-37
Stay Stupid The three dumbest guys I can think of: Charles Lindbergh, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill. Why? Because any smart person who understood how impossibly arduous were the tasks they had set themselves would have pulled the plug before he even began.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 138-40
Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur’s indispensable allies. She must be clueless enough to have no idea how difficult her enterprise is going to be—and cocky enough to believe she can pull it off anyway.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 140-42
A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It’s only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. Don’t think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 143-46
Be Stubborn Once we commit to action, the worst thing we can do is to stop.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 147-48
We don’t have to be heroes to be stubborn. We can just be pains in the butt. When we’re stubborn, there’s no quit in us. We’re mean. We’re mulish. We’re ornery. We’re in till the finish.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 150-52
Our mightiest ally (our indispensable ally) is belief in something we cannot see, hear, touch, taste, or feel.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 155-56
Imagine a box with a lid. Hold the box in your hand. Now open it. What’s inside? It might be a frog, a silk scarf, a gold coin of Persia. But here’s the trick: no matter how many times you open the box, there is always something in it. Ask me my religion. That’s it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 159-62
I believe with unshakeable faith that there will always be something in the box.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 162-63
Fear saps passion. When we conquer our fears, we discover a boundless, bottomless, inexhaustible well of passion.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 166-68
Resistance is the shadow, its opposite—Assistance—is the sun.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 169
Friends and Family When art and inspiration and success and fame and money have come and gone, who still loves us—and whom do we love? Only two things will remain with us across the river: our inhering genius and the hearts we love. In other words, what we do and whom we do it for.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 170-73
Start Before You’re Ready Don’t prepare. Begin. Remember, our enemy is not lack of preparation; it’s not the difficulty of the project or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account. The enemy is Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 177-80
The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do. Start before you’re ready.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 180-82
Good things happen when we start before we’re ready. For one thing, we show huevos. Our blood heats up. Courage begets more courage.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 183-84
W. H. Murray said: Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe’s couplets: “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” Begin it now.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 184-89
A Research Diet Before we begin, you wanna do research? Uh-unh. I’m putting you on a diet. You’re allowed to read three books on your subject. No more. No underlining, no highlighting, no thinking or talking about the documents later. Let the ideas percolate. Let the unconscious do its work. Research can become Resistance. We want to work, not prepare to work.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 190-95

1. Stay Primitive The creative act is primitive. Its principles are of birth and genesis. Babies are born in blood and chaos; stars and galaxies come into being amid the release of massive primordial cataclysms. Conception occurs at the primal level. I’m not being facetious when I stress, throughout this book, that it is better to be primitive than to be sophisticated, and better to be stupid than to be smart. The most highly cultured mother gives birth sweating and dislocated and cursing like a sailor. That’s the place we inhabit as artists and innovators. It’s the place we must become comfortable with. The hospital room may be spotless and sterile, but birth itself will always take place amid chaos, pain, and blood.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 196-204
If you and I want to do great stuff, we can’t let ourselves work small. A home-run swing that results in a strikeout is better than a successful bunt or even a line-drive single. Start playing from power. We can always dial it back later. If we don’t swing for the seats from the start, we’ll never be able to drive a fastball into the upper deck.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 12, loc. 208-11
don’t overthink. Don’t overprepare. Don’t let research become Resistance. Don’t spend six months compiling a thousand-page tome detailing the emotional matrix and family history of every character in your book. Outline it fast. Now. On instinct. Discipline yourself to boil down your story/new business/philanthropic enterprise to a single page. Is this easy? Hell, no.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 216-20
Three-Act Structure Break the sheet of foolscap into three parts: beginning, middle, and end. This is how screenwriters and playwrights work. Act One, Act Two, Act Three.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 221-23
How Leonardo Did It Here’s the Last Supper in three acts on a single sheet of foolscap: Supper table stretching across the width of the canvas. Jesus standing in the center, apostles arrayed in various postures left and right. Perspective and background tailing off behind. That’s all Mr. Da V needed to start. The rest is details.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 224-29
At the conception stage, the artist works by instinct. What feels right? What does she love? Is this her pure vision? Does it feel so right to her that she can dedicate the next X years of her life to realizing it?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 239-41
Do you love your idea? Does it feel right on instinct? Are you willing to bleed for it?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 246
That’s Why They Call It Rewriting The old saw says there’s no such thing as writing, only rewriting. This is true. Better to have written a lousy ballet than to have composed no ballet at all. Get your idea down on paper. You can always tweak it later.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 252-55
Start at the End Here’s a trick that screenwriters use: work backwards. Begin at the finish. If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 256-58
Figure out where you want to go; then work backwards from there.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 260
how do I know where I want to go?” Answer the Question “What Is This About?” Start with the theme. What is this project about?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 261-63
what is it about? When you know that, you’ll know the end state. And when you know the end state, you’ll know the steps to take to get there.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 265-66
End first, then beginning and middle. That’s your startup, that’s your plan for competing in a triathlon, that’s your ballet.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 280-81
Thoughts and Chatter Have you ever meditated? Then you know what it feels like to shift your consciousness to a witnessing mode and to watch thoughts arise, float across your awareness, and then drift away, to be replaced by the next thought and the thought after that. These are not thoughts. They are chatter.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 283-86
“monkey-mind” chatter or the reflexive regurgitation of whatever my parents or teachers said, or whatever I saw on the news or read in a book, or heard somebody rap about, hanging around the street corner.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 287-88
don’t listen to the chatter. Pay no attention to those rambling, disjointed images and notions that drift across the movie screen of your mind. Those are not your thoughts. They are chatter. They are Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 289-92
Chatter is your mother and father’s well-intentioned expressions of caution, seeking to shield you from hurting yourself. Chatter is your teachers’ equally well-meaning attempts at socialization, training you to follow the rules. Chatter is your friends’ regular-Joe buddy-talk, trying to make you like them and follow the rules of the pack. Chatter is Resistance. Its aim is to reconcile you to “the way it is,” to make you exactly like everyone else, to render you amenable to societal order and discipline.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 293-97
Where do our own real thoughts come from? How can we access them? From what source does our true, authentic self speak? Answering that is the work you and I will do for the rest of our lives.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 297-99
Ready to roll? We need only to remember our three mantras: Stay primitive. Trust the soup. Swing for the seats. And our final-final precept: 4. Be ready for Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 302-6
The Universe Is Not Indifferent I blame Communism. I blame Fascism. I blame psychotherapy. They—and a boatload of other well-intentioned ideologies that evolved during the mass-culture, industrialized, dehumanizing epoch of the late 19th and early 20th centuries—all posited the same fantasy. They all preached that human nature was perfectible and that, thereby, evil could be overcome. It can’t.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 307-11
When you and I set out to create anything—art, commerce, science, love—or to advance in the direction of a higher, nobler version of ourselves, we uncork from the universe, ineluctably, an equal and opposite reaction. That reaction is Resistance. Resistance is an active, intelligent, protean, malign force—tireless, relentless, and inextinguishable—whose sole object is to stop us from becoming our best selves and from achieving our higher goals.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 311-15
The universe is not indifferent. It is actively hostile.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 315-16
We can never eliminate Resistance. It will never go away. But we can outsmart it, and we can enlist allies that are as powerful as it is.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 317-18
One thing we can never, never permit ourselves to do is to take Resistance lightly, to underestimate it or to fail to take it into account. We must respect Resistance, like Sigourney Weaver respected the Alien, or St. George respected the dragon.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 319-21
David Lean famously declared that a feature film should have seven or eight major sequences. That’s a pretty good guideline
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 323-24
We need to fill in the gaps with a series of great entertaining and enlightening scenes, sequences, or spaces.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 328
Do research early or late. Don’t stop working. Never do research in prime working time. Research can be fun. It can be seductive. That’s its danger. We need it, we love it. But we must never forget that research can become Resistance. Soak up what you need to fill in the gaps. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 330-33
How Screenwriters Pitch When movie writers pitch a project, they keep it brief because studio executives’ attention spans are minimal. But they, the writers, want their presentation to have maximum impact and to deliver, in concise form, the feel and flavor of the film they see in their heads. One trick they use is to boil down their presentation to the following: A killer opening scene Two major set pieces in the middle A killer climax A concise statement of the theme In other words, they’re filling in the gaps. The major beats.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 333-41
Any project or enterprise can be broken down into beginning, middle, and end. Fill in the gaps; then fill in the gaps between the gaps.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 345-46
Cover the Canvas One rule for first full working drafts: get them done ASAP. Don’t worry about quality. Act, don’t reflect. Momentum is everything.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 348-50
Get to THE END as if the devil himself were breathing down your neck and poking you in the butt with his pitchfork.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 350-51
Don’t stop. Don’t look down. Don’t think.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 353-54
Suspend All Self-Judgment Unless you’re building a sailboat or the Taj Mahal, I give you a free pass to screw up as much as you like. The inner critic? His ass is not permitted in the building. Set forth without fear and without self-censorship. When you hear that voice in your head, blow it off. This draft is not being graded. There will be no pop quiz. Only one thing matters in this initial draft: get SOMETHING done, however flawed or imperfect. You are not allowed to judge yourself.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 21, loc. 354-60
The darker the better, if that’s how it’s coming to him. Suspending self-judgment doesn’t just mean blowing off the “You suck” voice in our heads. It also means liberating ourselves from conventional expectations—from what we think our work “ought” to be or “should” look like. Stay stupid. Follow your unconventional, crazy heart. If your notion violates every precept I’ve set forth in these pages, tell me to go to hell. Do what that voice says.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 21, loc. 365-69
Ideas Do Not Come Linearly Remember when we broke our concept down into beginning, middle, and end? Rational thought would tempt us to do our work in that order. Wrong. Ideas come according to their own logic. That logic is not rational. It’s not linear. We may get the middle before we get the end. We may get the end before we get the beginning. Be ready for this. Don’t resist it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 370-74
Do you have a pocket tape recorder? I do. I keep it with me everywhere. (A notepad works, too.) Why do I record ideas the minute they come to me? Because if I don’t, I’ll forget them. You will, too. Nothing is more fun than turning on the recorder and hearing your own voice telling you a fantastic idea that you had completely forgotten you had.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 374-77
The Process Let’s talk about the actual process—the writing/composing/ idea generation process. It progresses in two stages: action and reflection. Act, reflect. Act, reflect. NEVER act and reflect at the same time.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 377-81
The Definition of Action and Reflection In writing, “action” means putting words on paper. “Reflection” means evaluating what we have on paper. For this first draft, we’ll go light on reflection and heavy on action.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 381-84
When we say “Stay Stupid,” we mean don’t self-censor, don’t indulge in self-doubt, don’t permit self-judgment. Forget rational thought. Play. Play like a child.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 388-89
our idea (our song, our ballet, our new Tex-Mex restaurant) is smarter than we are. Our job is not to control our idea; our job is to figure out what our idea is (and wants to be)—and then bring it into being.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 390-92
The song we’re composing already exists in potential. Our work is to find it. Can we hear it in our head? It exists, like a signal coming from a faraway radio tower. Our job is to tune to that frequency.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 393-94
The Answer Is Always Yes When an idea pops into our head and we think, “No, this is too crazy,” … that’s the idea we want. When we think, “This notion is completely off the wall … should I even take the time to work on this?” … the answer is yes. Never doubt the soup. Never say no. The answer is always yes.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 397-402
The universe is also actively benevolent. You should be feeling this now. You should be feeling a tailwind. The opposite of Resistance is Assistance. A work-in-progress generates its own energy field. You, the artist or entrepreneur, are pouring love into the work; you are suffusing it with passion and intention and hope. This is serious juju. The universe responds to this. It has no choice. Your work-in-progress produces its own gravitational field, created by your will and your attention. This field attracts like-spirited entities into its orbit. What entities? Ideas.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 24, loc. 405-11
Your will and vision initiated the process, but now the process has acquired a life and momentum of its own. The un-indifferent universe has stepped in to counter Resistance. It has introduced a positive opposing force. Assistance is the universal, immutable force of creative manifestation, whose role since the Big Bang has been to translate potential into being, to convert dreams into reality.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 413-16
term)—momentum is everything. Keep it going. How much time can you spare each day? For that interval, close the door and—short of a family emergency or the outbreak of World War III—don’t let ANYBODY in. Keep working. Keep working. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 419-22
Ignore false negatives. Ignore false positives. Both are Resistance. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 425-26
Act, then reflect. Act, then reflect. Here’s how I do it: At least twice a week, I pause in the rush of work and have a meeting with myself. (If I were part of a team, I’d call a team meeting.) I ask myself, again, of the project: “What is this damn thing about?” Keep refining your understanding of the theme; keep narrowing it down. This is the thorniest nut of any creative endeavor—and the one that evokes the fiercest Resistance. It is pure hell to answer this question. More books, movies, new businesses, etc. get screwed up (or rather, screw themselves up) due to failure to confront and solve this issue than for any other reason. It is make-or-break, do-or-die.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 26, loc. 431-38
Have that meeting twice a week. Pause and reflect. “What is this project about?” “What is its theme?” “Is every element serving that theme?”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 26, loc. 440-41
Fill in the Gaps, Part Two Ask yourself, “What’s missing?” Then fill that gap.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 27, loc. 442-43
Ask yourself what’s missing. Then fill that void.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 27, loc. 456
We’ve established habit and rhythm. We’ve achieved momentum. Ideas are flowing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 28, loc. 458-59
The Wall And then we hit the wall. Out of nowhere, terror strikes. Our fragile confidence collapses. Nighttime: we wake in a sweat. That “You suck” voice is back, howling in our head.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 28, loc. 466-69
We’re poised at the brink of a creative breakthrough and we can’t stand it. The prospect of success looms. We freak. Why did we start this project? We must have been insane. Who encouraged us? We want to wring their necks. Where are they now? Why can’t they help us?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 29, loc. 471-73
We’re halfway, two-thirds through. Far enough to have invested serious time and money, not to mention our hopes, our dreams, our identity even—but not far enough to have passed the crisis point, not far enough to glimpse the end.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 29, loc. 473-75
Principle Number One: There Is an Enemy The first principle of Resistance is that there is an enemy. In our feel-good, social-safety-net, high-self-esteem world, you and I have been brainwashed to believe that there is no such thing as evil, that human nature is perfectible, that everyone and everything can be made nice. We have been conditioned to imagine that the darkness that we see in the world and feel in our own hearts is only an illusion, which can be dispelled by the proper care, the proper love, the proper education, and the proper funding. It can’t. There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 491-98
Principle Number Two: This Enemy Is Implacable
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 500
“It will kill you. It will kill you like cancer.” This enemy is intelligent, protean, implacable, inextinguishable, and utterly ruthless and destructive. Its aim is not to obstruct or to hamper or to impede. Its aim is to kill. This is the second principle of Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 502-5
Principle Number Three: This Enemy Is Inside You
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 506
Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. It does not arise from rivals, bosses, spouses, children, terrorists, lobbyists, or political adversaries. It comes from us.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 509-10
The enemy is inside you.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 512-13
Principle Number Four: The Enemy Is Inside You, But It Is Not You
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 513-14
What does that mean? It means you are not to blame for the voices of Resistance you hear in your head. They are not your “fault.” You have done nothing “wrong.” You have committed no “sin.” I have that same voice in my head. So did Picasso and Einstein. So do Sarah Palin and Lady Gaga and Donald Trump. If you’ve got a head, you’ve got a voice of Resistance inside it. The enemy is in you, but it is not you. No moral judgment attaches to the possession of it. You “have” Resistance the same way you “have” a heartbeat. You are blameless. You retain free will and the capacity to act.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 515-21
Principle Number Five: The “Real You” Must Duel the “Resistance You” On the field of the Self stand a knight and a dragon. You are the knight. Resistance is the dragon. There is no way to be nice to the dragon, or to reason with it or negotiate with it or beam a white light around it and make it your friend. The dragon belches fire and lives only to block you from reaching the gold of wisdom and freedom, which it has been charged to guard to its final breath. The only intercourse possible between the knight and the dragon is battle. The contest is life-and-death, mano a mano. It asks no quarter and gives none.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 32, loc. 521-29
Principle Number Six: Resistance Arises Second The sixth principle of Resistance (and the key to overcoming it) is that Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us. Resistance is the response of the frightened, petty, small-time ego to the brave, generous, magnificent impulse of the creative self. Resistance is the shadow cast by the innovative self’s sun.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 32, loc. 530-35
before the dragon of Resistance reared its ugly head and breathed fire into our faces, there existed within us a force so potent and life-affirming that it summoned this beast into being, perversely, to combat it. It means that, at bottom, Resistance is not the towering, all-powerful monster before whom we are compelled to quake in terror.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 536-39
Love for the material, love for the work, love for our brothers and sisters to whom we will offer our work as a gift. In Greek, the word is eros. Life force. Dynamis, creative drive. That mischievous tree-climbing scamp is our friend. She’s us, she’s our higher nature, our Self. In the face of Resistance, we have to remember her and hang onto her and draw strength from her. The opposite of fear is love—love of the challenge, love of the work, the pure joyous passion to take a shot at our dream and see if we can pull it off.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 541-47
Principle Number Seven: The Opposite of Resistance Is Assistance In myths and legends, the knight is always aided in his quest to slay the dragon. Providence brings forth a champion whose role is to assist the hero. Theseus had Ariadne when he fought the Minotaur. Jason had Medea when he went after the Golden Fleece. Odysseus had the goddess Athena to guide him home.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 547-51
They are symbols for the unmanifested. They stand for a dream. The dream is your project, your vision, your symphony, your startup. The love is the passion and enthusiasm that fill your heart when you envision your project’s completion.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 34, loc. 553-55
The seventh principle of Resistance is that we can align ourselves with these universal forces of Assistance—this dream, this passion to make the unmanifest manifest—and ride them into battle against the dragon.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 564-65
Resistance’s Two Tests Resistance puts two questions to each and all of us. Each question has only one correct answer.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 566-67
Test Number One “How bad do you want it?”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 568-69
Test Number Two “Why do you want it?”

The Attitude Adjustment Chamber Did you ever see Cool Hand Luke? Remember “the Box”? You don’t get to keep anything when you enter this space.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 583-85
The only items you get to keep are love for the work, will to finish, and passion to serve the ethical, creative Muse.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 595
The Big Crash is so predictable, across all fields of enterprise, that we can practically set our watches by it. Bank on it. It’s gonna happen.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 604-5
nothing can prepare us for it. Why? Because the crash arises organically, spawned by some act of commission or omission that we ourselves took or countenanced back at the project’s inception.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 606-7
There’s a difference between Navy SEAL training and what you and I are facing now. Our ordeal is harder. Because we’re alone.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 38, loc. 624-26
Crashes Are Good Crashes are hell, but in the end they’re good for us. A crash means we have failed. We gave it everything we had and we came up short. A crash does not mean we are losers. A crash means we have to grow. A crash means we’re at the threshold of learning something, which means we’re getting better, we’re acquiring the wisdom of our craft. A crash compels us to figure out what works and what doesn’t work—and to understand the difference. We got ourselves into this mess by mistakes we made at the start. How?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 38, loc. 632-38
the Big Crash compels us to go back now and solve the problem that we either created directly or set into motion unwittingly at the outset.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 639-40
Panic Is Good Creative panic is good. Here’s why: Our greatest fear is fear of success. When we are succeeding—that is, when we have begun to overcome our self-doubt and self-sabotage, when we are advancing in our craft and evolving to a higher level—that’s when panic strikes.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 641-45
When we experience panic, it means that we’re about to cross a threshold. We’re poised on the doorstep of a higher plane.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 646-47
panic was momentary, a natural part of the process of growth.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 651-52
Panic is good. It’s a sign that we’re growing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 653-54
The Problem Is the Problem A professional does not take success or failure personally. That’s Priority Number One for us now. That our project has crashed is not a reflection of our worth as human beings. It’s just a mistake. It’s a problem—and a problem can be solved.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 661-64
Where did we go wrong? Where did this train go off the tracks?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 665
The bad news is, the problem is hell. The good news is it’s just a problem. It’s not us. We are not worthless or evil or crazy. We’re just us, facing a problem.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 670-72
Work the Problem
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 41, loc. 673
nothing mystical, nothing New Age-y, nothing involving the Law of Attraction. The solution was mechanical.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 41, loc. 684-85
No matter how great a writer, artist, or entrepreneur, he is a mortal, he is fallible. He is not proof against Resistance. He will drop the ball; he will crash. That’s why they call it rewriting.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 731-33
The Point for Us The point for you and me is that we have passed through hell. We have worked our problem. We have solved it. We have escaped from the belly of the beast.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 733-36
Killer Instinct Why does Seth Godin place so much emphasis on “shipping”? Because finishing is the critical part of any project. If we can’t finish, all our work is for nothing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 737-40
It takes balls of steel to ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 742
Shipping is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. It requires killer instinct. We’ve got the monster down; now we have to drive a stake through its heart.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 746-47
Resistance was strongest at the finish. He did what he had to do, no matter how nutty or unorthodox, to finish and be ready to ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 760-61
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 764-69
When we’re offered a chance at heaven, what diabolically craven force makes us want to back off—just for now, we promise ourselves—and choose instead heaven’s pale reflection?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 774-76
Fear of success is the essence of Resistance. It’s silent, covert, invisible … but it permeates every aspect of our lives and poisons them in ways we’re either blind to or in denial about.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 46, loc. 776-78
When we ship, we’re exposed. That’s why we’re so afraid of it. When we ship, we’ll be judged. The real world will pronounce upon our work and upon us. When we ship, we can fail. When we ship, we can be humiliated.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 46, loc. 784-86
you’re taking a few blows. That’s the price for being in the arena and not on the sidelines. Stop complaining and be grateful.” That was when I realized I had become a pro. I had not yet had a success. But I had had a real failure.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 47, loc. 801-3
When we ship, we open ourselves to judgment in the real world. Nothing is more empowering, because it plants us solidly on Planet Earth and gets us out of our self-devouring, navel-centered fantasies and self-delusions. Ship it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 47, loc. 803-5
Slay that dragon once, and he will never have power over you again. Yeah, he’ll still be there. Yeah, you’ll still have to duel him every morning. And yeah, he’ll still fight just as hard and use just as many nasty tricks as he ever did. But you will have beaten him once, and you’ll know you can beat him again. That’s a game-changer. That will transform your life. From the day I finally finished something, I’ve never had trouble finishing anything again. I always deliver. I always ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 48, loc. 812-17
I stand in awe of anyone who hatches a dream and who shows the guts to hang tough, all alone, and see it through to

If no one has congratulated you, I do that now. You have joined an elite fraternity, whether you realize it or not. By dint of your efforts and your perseverance, you have initiated yourself into an invisible freemasonry whose members are awarded no badges or insignia, share no secret handshake, and wear no funny-looking hats. But the fellows of this society recognize one another. I recognize you. I salute you.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 49, loc. 831-35
You can be proud of yourself. You’ve done something that millions talk about but only a handful actually perform. And if you can do it once, you can do it again. I don’t care if you fail with this project. I don’t care if you fail a thousand times. You have done what only mothers and gods do: you have created new life.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 50, loc. 835-38
Start (Again) Before You’re Ready I was living in a little town in northern California when I finally, after seventeen years of trying, finished my first novel. I drove over to my friend and mentor Paul Rink’s house and told him what I had done. “Good for you,” he said. “Now start the next one.”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 50, loc. 839-41
Give yourself a standing ovation. Then get back to work. Begin the next one tomorrow. Stay stupid. Trust the soup. Start before you’re ready.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 50, loc. 843-46
In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent shared this thought, “Blessed is he who has found his work.”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 51, loc. 864-65
We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at flood—it ebbs. We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, “Too late.” Martin Luther King, Jr. Beyond Vietnam – A Time to Break Silence

Our Enemies The following is a list of the forces arrayed against us as artists and entrepreneurs: Resistance (i.e., fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism, etc.) Rational thought Friends and family
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 4, loc. 65-69
any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these acts will elicit Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 4, loc. 85-87
Resistance Is Invisible Resistance cannot be seen, heard, touched, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. Resistance is a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 88-91
Resistance Is Insidious Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that’s what it takes to deceive you. Resistance will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 91-97
Resistance Is Impersonal Resistance is not out to get you personally. It doesn’t know who you are and doesn’t care. Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively. Though it feels malevolent, Resistance in fact operates with the indifference of rain and transits the heavens by the same laws as stars.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 97-101
Resistance Is Infallible Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North—meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing. We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 5, loc. 101-6
Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 106-7
Resistance Never Sleeps Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance, even when he was seventy-five. In other words, fear doesn’t go away. The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 109-12
Resistance’s goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on this earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 6, loc. 114-17
Rational Thought Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneur’s worst enemy. Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego. Instead, we want to work from the Self, that is, from instinct and intuition, from the unconscious.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 117-21
Homer began both The Iliad and The Odyssey with a prayer to the Muse. The Greeks’ greatest poet understood that genius did not reside within his fallible, mortal self—but came to him instead from some source that he could neither command nor control, only invoke.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 121-23
Friends and Family The problem with friends and family is that they know us as we are. They are invested in maintaining us as we are. The last thing we want is to remain as we are.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 126-29
With some exceptions (God bless them), friends and family are the enemy of this unmanifested you, this unborn self, this future being. Prepare yourself to make new friends. They will appear, trust me.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 7, loc. 130-32
Our Allies Enough for now about the antagonists arrayed against us. Let’s consider the champions on our side: Stupidity Stubbornness Blind faith Passion Assistance (the opposite of Resistance) Friends and family
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 132-37
Stay Stupid The three dumbest guys I can think of: Charles Lindbergh, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill. Why? Because any smart person who understood how impossibly arduous were the tasks they had set themselves would have pulled the plug before he even began.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 138-40
Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur’s indispensable allies. She must be clueless enough to have no idea how difficult her enterprise is going to be—and cocky enough to believe she can pull it off anyway.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 140-42
A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It’s only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. Don’t think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 143-46
Be Stubborn Once we commit to action, the worst thing we can do is to stop.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 147-48
We don’t have to be heroes to be stubborn. We can just be pains in the butt. When we’re stubborn, there’s no quit in us. We’re mean. We’re mulish. We’re ornery. We’re in till the finish.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 8, loc. 150-52
Our mightiest ally (our indispensable ally) is belief in something we cannot see, hear, touch, taste, or feel.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 155-56
Imagine a box with a lid. Hold the box in your hand. Now open it. What’s inside? It might be a frog, a silk scarf, a gold coin of Persia. But here’s the trick: no matter how many times you open the box, there is always something in it. Ask me my religion. That’s it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 159-62
I believe with unshakeable faith that there will always be something in the box.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 9, loc. 162-63
Fear saps passion. When we conquer our fears, we discover a boundless, bottomless, inexhaustible well of passion.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 166-68
Resistance is the shadow, its opposite—Assistance—is the sun.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 169
Friends and Family When art and inspiration and success and fame and money have come and gone, who still loves us—and whom do we love? Only two things will remain with us across the river: our inhering genius and the hearts we love. In other words, what we do and whom we do it for.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 170-73
Start Before You’re Ready Don’t prepare. Begin. Remember, our enemy is not lack of preparation; it’s not the difficulty of the project or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account. The enemy is Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 177-80
The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do. Start before you’re ready.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 10, loc. 180-82
Good things happen when we start before we’re ready. For one thing, we show huevos. Our blood heats up. Courage begets more courage.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 183-84
W. H. Murray said: Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe’s couplets: “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” Begin it now.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 184-89
A Research Diet Before we begin, you wanna do research? Uh-unh. I’m putting you on a diet. You’re allowed to read three books on your subject. No more. No underlining, no highlighting, no thinking or talking about the documents later. Let the ideas percolate. Let the unconscious do its work. Research can become Resistance. We want to work, not prepare to work.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 190-95
1. Stay Primitive The creative act is primitive. Its principles are of birth and genesis. Babies are born in blood and chaos; stars and galaxies come into being amid the release of massive primordial cataclysms. Conception occurs at the primal level. I’m not being facetious when I stress, throughout this book, that it is better to be primitive than to be sophisticated, and better to be stupid than to be smart. The most highly cultured mother gives birth sweating and dislocated and cursing like a sailor. That’s the place we inhabit as artists and innovators. It’s the place we must become comfortable with. The hospital room may be spotless and sterile, but birth itself will always take place amid chaos, pain, and blood.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 11, loc. 196-204
If you and I want to do great stuff, we can’t let ourselves work small. A home-run swing that results in a strikeout is better than a successful bunt or even a line-drive single. Start playing from power. We can always dial it back later. If we don’t swing for the seats from the start, we’ll never be able to drive a fastball into the upper deck.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 12, loc. 208-11
don’t overthink. Don’t overprepare. Don’t let research become Resistance. Don’t spend six months compiling a thousand-page tome detailing the emotional matrix and family history of every character in your book. Outline it fast. Now. On instinct. Discipline yourself to boil down your story/new business/philanthropic enterprise to a single page. Is this easy? Hell, no.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 216-20
Three-Act Structure Break the sheet of foolscap into three parts: beginning, middle, and end. This is how screenwriters and playwrights work. Act One, Act Two, Act Three.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 221-23
How Leonardo Did It Here’s the Last Supper in three acts on a single sheet of foolscap: Supper table stretching across the width of the canvas. Jesus standing in the center, apostles arrayed in various postures left and right. Perspective and background tailing off behind. That’s all Mr. Da V needed to start. The rest is details.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 224-29
At the conception stage, the artist works by instinct. What feels right? What does she love? Is this her pure vision? Does it feel so right to her that she can dedicate the next X years of her life to realizing it?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 13, loc. 239-41
Do you love your idea? Does it feel right on instinct? Are you willing to bleed for it?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 246
That’s Why They Call It Rewriting The old saw says there’s no such thing as writing, only rewriting. This is true. Better to have written a lousy ballet than to have composed no ballet at all. Get your idea down on paper. You can always tweak it later.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 252-55
Start at the End Here’s a trick that screenwriters use: work backwards. Begin at the finish. If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 14, loc. 256-58
Figure out where you want to go; then work backwards from there.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 260
how do I know where I want to go?” Answer the Question “What Is This About?” Start with the theme. What is this project about?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 261-63
what is it about? When you know that, you’ll know the end state. And when you know the end state, you’ll know the steps to take to get there.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 15, loc. 265-66
End first, then beginning and middle. That’s your startup, that’s your plan for competing in a triathlon, that’s your ballet.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 280-81
Thoughts and Chatter Have you ever meditated? Then you know what it feels like to shift your consciousness to a witnessing mode and to watch thoughts arise, float across your awareness, and then drift away, to be replaced by the next thought and the thought after that. These are not thoughts. They are chatter.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 283-86
“monkey-mind” chatter or the reflexive regurgitation of whatever my parents or teachers said, or whatever I saw on the news or read in a book, or heard somebody rap about, hanging around the street corner.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 16, loc. 287-88
don’t listen to the chatter. Pay no attention to those rambling, disjointed images and notions that drift across the movie screen of your mind. Those are not your thoughts. They are chatter. They are Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 289-92
Chatter is your mother and father’s well-intentioned expressions of caution, seeking to shield you from hurting yourself. Chatter is your teachers’ equally well-meaning attempts at socialization, training you to follow the rules. Chatter is your friends’ regular-Joe buddy-talk, trying to make you like them and follow the rules of the pack. Chatter is Resistance. Its aim is to reconcile you to “the way it is,” to make you exactly like everyone else, to render you amenable to societal order and discipline.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 293-97
Where do our own real thoughts come from? How can we access them? From what source does our true, authentic self speak? Answering that is the work you and I will do for the rest of our lives.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 297-99
Ready to roll? We need only to remember our three mantras: Stay primitive. Trust the soup. Swing for the seats. And our final-final precept: 4. Be ready for Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 302-6
The Universe Is Not Indifferent I blame Communism. I blame Fascism. I blame psychotherapy. They—and a boatload of other well-intentioned ideologies that evolved during the mass-culture, industrialized, dehumanizing epoch of the late 19th and early 20th centuries—all posited the same fantasy. They all preached that human nature was perfectible and that, thereby, evil could be overcome. It can’t.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 17, loc. 307-11
When you and I set out to create anything—art, commerce, science, love—or to advance in the direction of a higher, nobler version of ourselves, we uncork from the universe, ineluctably, an equal and opposite reaction. That reaction is Resistance. Resistance is an active, intelligent, protean, malign force—tireless, relentless, and inextinguishable—whose sole object is to stop us from becoming our best selves and from achieving our higher goals.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 311-15
The universe is not indifferent. It is actively hostile.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 315-16
We can never eliminate Resistance. It will never go away. But we can outsmart it, and we can enlist allies that are as powerful as it is.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 317-18
One thing we can never, never permit ourselves to do is to take Resistance lightly, to underestimate it or to fail to take it into account. We must respect Resistance, like Sigourney Weaver respected the Alien, or St. George respected the dragon.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 18, loc. 319-21
David Lean famously declared that a feature film should have seven or eight major sequences. That’s a pretty good guideline
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 323-24
We need to fill in the gaps with a series of great entertaining and enlightening scenes, sequences, or spaces.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 328
Do research early or late. Don’t stop working. Never do research in prime working time. Research can be fun. It can be seductive. That’s its danger. We need it, we love it. But we must never forget that research can become Resistance. Soak up what you need to fill in the gaps. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 330-33
How Screenwriters Pitch When movie writers pitch a project, they keep it brief because studio executives’ attention spans are minimal. But they, the writers, want their presentation to have maximum impact and to deliver, in concise form, the feel and flavor of the film they see in their heads. One trick they use is to boil down their presentation to the following: A killer opening scene Two major set pieces in the middle A killer climax A concise statement of the theme In other words, they’re filling in the gaps. The major beats.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 19, loc. 333-41
Any project or enterprise can be broken down into beginning, middle, and end. Fill in the gaps; then fill in the gaps between the gaps.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 345-46
Cover the Canvas One rule for first full working drafts: get them done ASAP. Don’t worry about quality. Act, don’t reflect. Momentum is everything.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 348-50
Get to THE END as if the devil himself were breathing down your neck and poking you in the butt with his pitchfork.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 350-51
Don’t stop. Don’t look down. Don’t think.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 20, loc. 353-54
Suspend All Self-Judgment Unless you’re building a sailboat or the Taj Mahal, I give you a free pass to screw up as much as you like. The inner critic? His ass is not permitted in the building. Set forth without fear and without self-censorship. When you hear that voice in your head, blow it off. This draft is not being graded. There will be no pop quiz. Only one thing matters in this initial draft: get SOMETHING done, however flawed or imperfect. You are not allowed to judge yourself.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 21, loc. 354-60
The darker the better, if that’s how it’s coming to him. Suspending self-judgment doesn’t just mean blowing off the “You suck” voice in our heads. It also means liberating ourselves from conventional expectations—from what we think our work “ought” to be or “should” look like. Stay stupid. Follow your unconventional, crazy heart. If your notion violates every precept I’ve set forth in these pages, tell me to go to hell. Do what that voice says.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 21, loc. 365-69
Ideas Do Not Come Linearly Remember when we broke our concept down into beginning, middle, and end? Rational thought would tempt us to do our work in that order. Wrong. Ideas come according to their own logic. That logic is not rational. It’s not linear. We may get the middle before we get the end. We may get the end before we get the beginning. Be ready for this. Don’t resist it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 370-74
Do you have a pocket tape recorder? I do. I keep it with me everywhere. (A notepad works, too.) Why do I record ideas the minute they come to me? Because if I don’t, I’ll forget them. You will, too. Nothing is more fun than turning on the recorder and hearing your own voice telling you a fantastic idea that you had completely forgotten you had.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 374-77
The Process Let’s talk about the actual process—the writing/composing/ idea generation process. It progresses in two stages: action and reflection. Act, reflect. Act, reflect. NEVER act and reflect at the same time.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 377-81
The Definition of Action and Reflection In writing, “action” means putting words on paper. “Reflection” means evaluating what we have on paper. For this first draft, we’ll go light on reflection and heavy on action.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 22, loc. 381-84
When we say “Stay Stupid,” we mean don’t self-censor, don’t indulge in self-doubt, don’t permit self-judgment. Forget rational thought. Play. Play like a child.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 388-89
our idea (our song, our ballet, our new Tex-Mex restaurant) is smarter than we are. Our job is not to control our idea; our job is to figure out what our idea is (and wants to be)—and then bring it into being.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 390-92
The song we’re composing already exists in potential. Our work is to find it. Can we hear it in our head? It exists, like a signal coming from a faraway radio tower. Our job is to tune to that frequency.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 393-94
The Answer Is Always Yes When an idea pops into our head and we think, “No, this is too crazy,” … that’s the idea we want. When we think, “This notion is completely off the wall … should I even take the time to work on this?” … the answer is yes. Never doubt the soup. Never say no. The answer is always yes.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 23, loc. 397-402
The universe is also actively benevolent. You should be feeling this now. You should be feeling a tailwind. The opposite of Resistance is Assistance. A work-in-progress generates its own energy field. You, the artist or entrepreneur, are pouring love into the work; you are suffusing it with passion and intention and hope. This is serious juju. The universe responds to this. It has no choice. Your work-in-progress produces its own gravitational field, created by your will and your attention. This field attracts like-spirited entities into its orbit. What entities? Ideas.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 24, loc. 405-11
Your will and vision initiated the process, but now the process has acquired a life and momentum of its own. The un-indifferent universe has stepped in to counter Resistance. It has introduced a positive opposing force. Assistance is the universal, immutable force of creative manifestation, whose role since the Big Bang has been to translate potential into being, to convert dreams into reality.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 413-16
term)—momentum is everything. Keep it going. How much time can you spare each day? For that interval, close the door and—short of a family emergency or the outbreak of World War III—don’t let ANYBODY in. Keep working. Keep working. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 419-22
Ignore false negatives. Ignore false positives. Both are Resistance. Keep working.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 25, loc. 425-26
Act, then reflect. Act, then reflect. Here’s how I do it: At least twice a week, I pause in the rush of work and have a meeting with myself. (If I were part of a team, I’d call a team meeting.) I ask myself, again, of the project: “What is this damn thing about?” Keep refining your understanding of the theme; keep narrowing it down. This is the thorniest nut of any creative endeavor—and the one that evokes the fiercest Resistance. It is pure hell to answer this question. More books, movies, new businesses, etc. get screwed up (or rather, screw themselves up) due to failure to confront and solve this issue than for any other reason. It is make-or-break, do-or-die.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 26, loc. 431-38
Have that meeting twice a week. Pause and reflect. “What is this project about?” “What is its theme?” “Is every element serving that theme?”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 26, loc. 440-41
Fill in the Gaps, Part Two Ask yourself, “What’s missing?” Then fill that gap.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 27, loc. 442-43
Ask yourself what’s missing. Then fill that void.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 27, loc. 456
We’ve established habit and rhythm. We’ve achieved momentum. Ideas are flowing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 28, loc. 458-59
The Wall And then we hit the wall. Out of nowhere, terror strikes. Our fragile confidence collapses. Nighttime: we wake in a sweat. That “You suck” voice is back, howling in our head.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 28, loc. 466-69
We’re poised at the brink of a creative breakthrough and we can’t stand it. The prospect of success looms. We freak. Why did we start this project? We must have been insane. Who encouraged us? We want to wring their necks. Where are they now? Why can’t they help us?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 29, loc. 471-73
We’re halfway, two-thirds through. Far enough to have invested serious time and money, not to mention our hopes, our dreams, our identity even—but not far enough to have passed the crisis point, not far enough to glimpse the end.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 29, loc. 473-75
Principle Number One: There Is an Enemy The first principle of Resistance is that there is an enemy. In our feel-good, social-safety-net, high-self-esteem world, you and I have been brainwashed to believe that there is no such thing as evil, that human nature is perfectible, that everyone and everything can be made nice. We have been conditioned to imagine that the darkness that we see in the world and feel in our own hearts is only an illusion, which can be dispelled by the proper care, the proper love, the proper education, and the proper funding. It can’t. There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 491-98
Principle Number Two: This Enemy Is Implacable
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 500
“It will kill you. It will kill you like cancer.” This enemy is intelligent, protean, implacable, inextinguishable, and utterly ruthless and destructive. Its aim is not to obstruct or to hamper or to impede. Its aim is to kill. This is the second principle of Resistance.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 30, loc. 502-5
Principle Number Three: This Enemy Is Inside You
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 506
Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. It does not arise from rivals, bosses, spouses, children, terrorists, lobbyists, or political adversaries. It comes from us.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 509-10
The enemy is inside you.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 512-13
Principle Number Four: The Enemy Is Inside You, But It Is Not You
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 513-14
What does that mean? It means you are not to blame for the voices of Resistance you hear in your head. They are not your “fault.” You have done nothing “wrong.” You have committed no “sin.” I have that same voice in my head. So did Picasso and Einstein. So do Sarah Palin and Lady Gaga and Donald Trump. If you’ve got a head, you’ve got a voice of Resistance inside it. The enemy is in you, but it is not you. No moral judgment attaches to the possession of it. You “have” Resistance the same way you “have” a heartbeat. You are blameless. You retain free will and the capacity to act.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 31, loc. 515-21
Principle Number Five: The “Real You” Must Duel the “Resistance You” On the field of the Self stand a knight and a dragon. You are the knight. Resistance is the dragon. There is no way to be nice to the dragon, or to reason with it or negotiate with it or beam a white light around it and make it your friend. The dragon belches fire and lives only to block you from reaching the gold of wisdom and freedom, which it has been charged to guard to its final breath. The only intercourse possible between the knight and the dragon is battle. The contest is life-and-death, mano a mano. It asks no quarter and gives none.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 32, loc. 521-29
Principle Number Six: Resistance Arises Second The sixth principle of Resistance (and the key to overcoming it) is that Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us. Resistance is the response of the frightened, petty, small-time ego to the brave, generous, magnificent impulse of the creative self. Resistance is the shadow cast by the innovative self’s sun.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 32, loc. 530-35
before the dragon of Resistance reared its ugly head and breathed fire into our faces, there existed within us a force so potent and life-affirming that it summoned this beast into being, perversely, to combat it. It means that, at bottom, Resistance is not the towering, all-powerful monster before whom we are compelled to quake in terror.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 536-39
Love for the material, love for the work, love for our brothers and sisters to whom we will offer our work as a gift. In Greek, the word is eros. Life force. Dynamis, creative drive. That mischievous tree-climbing scamp is our friend. She’s us, she’s our higher nature, our Self. In the face of Resistance, we have to remember her and hang onto her and draw strength from her. The opposite of fear is love—love of the challenge, love of the work, the pure joyous passion to take a shot at our dream and see if we can pull it off.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 541-47
Principle Number Seven: The Opposite of Resistance Is Assistance In myths and legends, the knight is always aided in his quest to slay the dragon. Providence brings forth a champion whose role is to assist the hero. Theseus had Ariadne when he fought the Minotaur. Jason had Medea when he went after the Golden Fleece. Odysseus had the goddess Athena to guide him home.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 33, loc. 547-51
They are symbols for the unmanifested. They stand for a dream. The dream is your project, your vision, your symphony, your startup. The love is the passion and enthusiasm that fill your heart when you envision your project’s completion.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 34, loc. 553-55
The seventh principle of Resistance is that we can align ourselves with these universal forces of Assistance—this dream, this passion to make the unmanifest manifest—and ride them into battle against the dragon.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 564-65
Resistance’s Two Tests Resistance puts two questions to each and all of us. Each question has only one correct answer.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 566-67
Test Number One “How bad do you want it?”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 568-69
Test Number Two “Why do you want it?”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 573-74
The Attitude Adjustment Chamber Did you ever see Cool Hand Luke? Remember “the Box”? You don’t get to keep anything when you enter this space.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 35, loc. 583-85
The only items you get to keep are love for the work, will to finish, and passion to serve the ethical, creative Muse.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 595
The Big Crash is so predictable, across all fields of enterprise, that we can practically set our watches by it. Bank on it. It’s gonna happen.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 604-5
nothing can prepare us for it. Why? Because the crash arises organically, spawned by some act of commission or omission that we ourselves took or countenanced back at the project’s inception.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 36, loc. 606-7
There’s a difference between Navy SEAL training and what you and I are facing now. Our ordeal is harder. Because we’re alone.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 38, loc. 624-26
Crashes Are Good Crashes are hell, but in the end they’re good for us. A crash means we have failed. We gave it everything we had and we came up short. A crash does not mean we are losers. A crash means we have to grow. A crash means we’re at the threshold of learning something, which means we’re getting better, we’re acquiring the wisdom of our craft. A crash compels us to figure out what works and what doesn’t work—and to understand the difference. We got ourselves into this mess by mistakes we made at the start. How?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 38, loc. 632-38
the Big Crash compels us to go back now and solve the problem that we either created directly or set into motion unwittingly at the outset.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 639-40
Panic Is Good Creative panic is good. Here’s why: Our greatest fear is fear of success. When we are succeeding—that is, when we have begun to overcome our self-doubt and self-sabotage, when we are advancing in our craft and evolving to a higher level—that’s when panic strikes.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 641-45
When we experience panic, it means that we’re about to cross a threshold. We’re poised on the doorstep of a higher plane.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 646-47
panic was momentary, a natural part of the process of growth.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 39, loc. 651-52
Panic is good. It’s a sign that we’re growing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 653-54
The Problem Is the Problem A professional does not take success or failure personally. That’s Priority Number One for us now. That our project has crashed is not a reflection of our worth as human beings. It’s just a mistake. It’s a problem—and a problem can be solved.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 661-64
Where did we go wrong? Where did this train go off the tracks?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 665
The bad news is, the problem is hell. The good news is it’s just a problem. It’s not us. We are not worthless or evil or crazy. We’re just us, facing a problem.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 40, loc. 670-72
Work the Problem
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 41, loc. 673
nothing mystical, nothing New Age-y, nothing involving the Law of Attraction. The solution was mechanical.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 41, loc. 684-85
No matter how great a writer, artist, or entrepreneur, he is a mortal, he is fallible. He is not proof against Resistance. He will drop the ball; he will crash. That’s why they call it rewriting.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 731-33
The Point for Us The point for you and me is that we have passed through hell. We have worked our problem. We have solved it. We have escaped from the belly of the beast.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 733-36
Killer Instinct Why does Seth Godin place so much emphasis on “shipping”? Because finishing is the critical part of any project. If we can’t finish, all our work is for nothing.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 737-40
It takes balls of steel to ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 742
Shipping is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. It requires killer instinct. We’ve got the monster down; now we have to drive a stake through its heart.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 44, loc. 746-47
Resistance was strongest at the finish. He did what he had to do, no matter how nutty or unorthodox, to finish and be ready to ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 760-61
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 764-69
When we’re offered a chance at heaven, what diabolically craven force makes us want to back off—just for now, we promise ourselves—and choose instead heaven’s pale reflection?
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 45, loc. 774-76
Fear of success is the essence of Resistance. It’s silent, covert, invisible … but it permeates every aspect of our lives and poisons them in ways we’re either blind to or in denial about.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 46, loc. 776-78
When we ship, we’re exposed. That’s why we’re so afraid of it. When we ship, we’ll be judged. The real world will pronounce upon our work and upon us. When we ship, we can fail. When we ship, we can be humiliated.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 46, loc. 784-86
you’re taking a few blows. That’s the price for being in the arena and not on the sidelines. Stop complaining and be grateful.” That was when I realized I had become a pro. I had not yet had a success. But I had had a real failure.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 47, loc. 801-3
When we ship, we open ourselves to judgment in the real world. Nothing is more empowering, because it plants us solidly on Planet Earth and gets us out of our self-devouring, navel-centered fantasies and self-delusions. Ship it.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 47, loc. 803-5
Slay that dragon once, and he will never have power over you again. Yeah, he’ll still be there. Yeah, you’ll still have to duel him every morning. And yeah, he’ll still fight just as hard and use just as many nasty tricks as he ever did. But you will have beaten him once, and you’ll know you can beat him again. That’s a game-changer. That will transform your life. From the day I finally finished something, I’ve never had trouble finishing anything again. I always deliver. I always ship.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 48, loc. 812-17

If no one has congratulated you, I do that now. You have joined an elite fraternity, whether you realize it or not. By dint of your efforts and your perseverance, you have initiated yourself into an invisible freemasonry whose members are awarded no badges or insignia, share no secret handshake, and wear no funny-looking hats. But the fellows of this society recognize one another. I recognize you. I salute you.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 49, loc. 831-35
You can be proud of yourself. You’ve done something that millions talk about but only a handful actually perform. And if you can do it once, you can do it again. I don’t care if you fail with this project. I don’t care if you fail a thousand times. You have done what only mothers and gods do: you have created new life.
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 50, loc. 835-38
Start (Again) Before You’re Ready I was living in a little town in northern California when I finally, after seventeen years of trying, finished my first novel. I drove over to my friend and mentor Paul Rink’s house and told him what I had done. “Good for you,” he said. “Now start the next one.”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 50, loc. 839-41
Give yourself a standing ovation. Then get back to work. Begin the next one tomorrow. Stay stupid. Trust the soup. Start before you’re ready.

In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent shared this thought, “Blessed is he who has found his work.”
Steven Pressfield, Do the Work, pg. 51, loc. 864-65
We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at flood—it ebbs. We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, “Too late.” Martin Luther King, Jr. Beyond Vietnam – A Time to Break Silence
