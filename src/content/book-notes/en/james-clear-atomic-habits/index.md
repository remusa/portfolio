A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 123-124
“the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 199-200
“The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 200-202
if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 227-229
Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 252-253
it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 253-254
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 257-257
Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 262-262
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 262-263
Productivity compounds.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 268-268
compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 297-298
But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 300-301
in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 300-301
If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 302-305
When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 305-306
Mastery requires patience.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 310-310
“When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 311-313
All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.

FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 324-325
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 331-332
Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 344-344
Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 345-346
Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 346-348
Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 352-353
Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 359-359
Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 360-360
goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 364-365
It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 365-367
Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 369-370
When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 371-372
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 374-375
it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 375-375
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 378-379
atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 408-408
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 410-410
The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results:
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 411-411
publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 412-412
Most of the goals
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 412-412
Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 412-412
The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems:
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 412-413
Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 414-414
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 415-415
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 415-416
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 415-416
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 417-417
build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 421-421
With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 425-426
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 434-435
There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 439-439
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 439-440
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 451-453
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 453-454
True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 457-458
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 464-464
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 464-465
Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 465-466
The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 483-485
Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 487-488
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 491-493
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 491-493
habits are how you embody your identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 493-493
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 495-497
As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 506-507
The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 507-509
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 513-514
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 513-515
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 517-518
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 522-524
You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 526-526
Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 527-527
New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 527-529
two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 529-531
What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values?

What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and

Start there and work backward from
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 534-535
Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 534-536
Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 543-544
feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 547-548
values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 549-549
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 549-550
the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 552-553
the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who.

James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 552-553
the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder.

James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 552-554
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 554-556
fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.

the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 587-588
“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 587-588
A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 591-591
The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this?
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 591-592
The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 591-593
Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 594-596
did I do right before that? This is
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 600-600
did I do right before that? This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 609-611
Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 615-615
complement each other. Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 627-627
same order each time. First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 631-632
same order each time. First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 631-633
First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 632-633
Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 636-637
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 637-639
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 637-639
Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 641-641
Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 644-645
Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 644-645
The third step is the response.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 645-646
The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 645-646
The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 645-647
The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 645-648
The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 645-648
Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 648-649
you’re out of luck. Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 649-650
The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 650-651
The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 652-652
But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.* This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” Pointing-and-Calling

If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 873-874
Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine.

This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference.

No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 956-956
One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 958-959
Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 959-960
The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 962-962
The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Effect.

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.

If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive.

Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.

dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.

It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.

the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it.

Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain.

Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.

In 1860, the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.”

repetition is a form of change.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 1759-1759
Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.

All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.

The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not time.

What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference.

Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.

In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 1828-1829
You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.

People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.

At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 2306-2306
The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.

The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.

The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.

Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing.

It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 2332-2333
Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious. Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 2383-2384
Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day.

Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive. The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.

Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 2397-2397
Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.

Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result.

habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.

Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you.

Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it.

We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.

As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to change.

If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.

What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.

What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.

What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else.

Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.

A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.

Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.

the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback.

reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 2973-2974
In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing.

In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference.

as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.

Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.

Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.

Happiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.

Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.

With a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.

Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”

Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level.
James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, loc. 3094-3094
Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.

We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.”

We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.” Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.

To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.

Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.

Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.

Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it.

Our expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future.

Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting This is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution.

The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation. When desire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first place. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”

Feelings come both before and after the behavior. Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.

Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains. Wanting and liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.
