Don't be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at life, ful of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of big dreams.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 29-30
Business is not about money. It's about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 32-33
Never do anything just for the money. Don't pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the cal s for help.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 34-35
Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what's not working. Your business plan is moot. You don't know what people real y want until you start doing it. Starting with no money is an advantage. You don't need money to start helping people. You can't please everyone, so proudly exclude people. Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business. The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 36-40
A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work. Hopeful y no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 88-89
A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work. Hopeful y no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tel you if the numbers wil work. The rest are details.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 88-90
“revolution” is a term that people use only when you're successful. Before that, you're just a quirky person who does things differently.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 91-92
When you're on to something great, it won't feel like revolution. It'l feel like uncommon sense.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 96-97
Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 105-106
When you present one to the world, and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as-is. Instead, get back to improving and inventing.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 107-107
If multiple people are saying, “Wow! Yes! I need this! I'd be happy to pay you to do this!” then you should probably do it. But if the response is anything less, don't pursue it.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 108-109
Don't waste years fighting uphil battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 109-110
No “yes.” Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 110-111
If you're not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.”
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 112-112
If you're not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hel yeah!”—then say “no.”
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 112-113
If you're not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hel yeah!”—then say “no.” When you say “no” to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “HELL YEAH!”
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 112-115
Any time you think you know what your new business wil be doing, remember this quote from Steve Blank: No plan survives
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 127-127
Any time you think you know what your new business wil be doing, remember this quote from Steve Blank: No plan survives first contact with customers.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 127-128
Necessity is a great teacher.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 140-140
Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. Make every decision—even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone—according to what's best for your customers.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 143-144
For an idea to get big big big, it has to be useful. And being useful doesn't need funding. If you want to be useful, you can always start now, with only 1 percent of what you have in your grand vision. It'l be a humble prototype version of your grand vision, but you'l be in the game.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 151-153

If you want to be useful, you can always start now, with only 1 percent of what you have in your grand vision. It'l be a humble prototype version of your grand vision, but you'l be in the game. You'l be ahead of the rest, because you actual y started, while others are waiting for the finish line to magical y appear at the starting line.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 151-154
Starting smal puts 100 percent of your energy on actual y solving real problems for real people. It gives you a stronger foundation to grow from. It eliminates the friction of big infrastructure and gets right to the point. And it wil let you change your plan in an instant, as you're working closely with those first customers tel ing you what they real y need.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 161-164
Ideas are just a multiplier of execution
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 170-170
ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth mil ions.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 172-172
Formalities play on fear. Bravely refuse.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 180-180
As your business grows, never let the leeches sucker you into al that stuff they pretend you need.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 191-192
When you build your business on serving thousands of customers, not dozens, you don't have to worry about any one customer leaving or making special demands. If most of your customers love what you do, but one doesn't, you can just say goodbye and wish him the best, with no hard feelings.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 206-208
Proudly exclude people
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 209-209
It's a big world. You can loudly leave out 99 percent of it.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 219-219
You can't pretend there's only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radical y different plans.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 246-247
You don't need a plan or a vision
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 251-251
Do you have a big visionary master plan for how the world wil work in twenty years? Do you have massive ambitions to revolutionize your industry? Don't feel bad if you don't. I never did.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 251-252
don't think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 262-263
Never forget why you're real y doing what you're doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn't that enough?

When someone's doing something for love, being generous instead of stingy, trusting instead of fearful, it triggers this law: We want to give to those who give.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 305-306

It's important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 320-321
When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. You're lucky to own your own business. Life is good. You can't prevent bad things from happening. Learn to shrug. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person's mistake.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 323-325
It's dehumanizing to have thousands of people passing through our computer screens, so we do things we'd never do if those people were sitting next to us.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 345-346
It's dehumanizing to have thousands of people passing through our computer screens, so we do things we'd never do if those people were sitting next to us. It's too overwhelming to remember that at the end of every computer is a real person, a lot like you, whose birthday was last week, who has three best friends but nobody to spoon at night, and who is personal y affected by what you say.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 345-348
it's often the tiny details that real y thril people enough to make them tel al their friends about you.

Even if you want to be big someday, remember that you never need to act like a big boring company.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 404-405
Don't try to impress an invisible jury of MBA professors. It's OK to be casual.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 415-416
There's a benefit to being naïve about the norms of the world— deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 431-433
no matter what business you're in, it's good to prepare for what would happen if business doubled.

if your internal processes are always designed to handle twice your existing load, it sends an attractive “come on in, we've got plenty of room” message to everyone.

It's about being, not having
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 444-444
It's not that I wanted to get it done and have good vocals. It's that I wanted to be a great singer.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 455-456
Being, not having: When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't understand. They'l assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing.

Being, not having: When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't understand. They'l assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you mil ions of dol ars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you're insisting on doing something yourself. But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy! That's it!
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 471-476
In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have. To have something (a finished recording, a business, or mil ions of dol ars) is the means, not the end. To be something (a good singer, a skil ed entrepreneur, or just plain happy) is the real point.

Delegate or die: The self-employed trap Most
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 561-561
Delegate or die: The self-employed trap Most self-employed people get caught in the delegation trap. You're so busy, doing everything yourself. You know you need help, but to find and train someone would take more time than you have. So you keep working harder, until you break.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 561-563
There's a big difference between being self-employed and being a business owner. Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles. To be a true business owner, make sure you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.

Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 605-606
Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be. Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let him do it.

Trust, but verify. Remember it when delegating. You have to do both.

Delegate, but don't abdicate Delegation doesn't come natural y to any of us.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 642-643
Delegate, but don't abdicate Delegation doesn't come natural y to any of us. But I was trying real y hard to be good at it. I knew how important it was to get into the delegation mindset. I was trying to empower my employees—to let them know they could make decisions on their own, without me.
Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 642-644
I learned an important word: abdicate. To abdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usual y used when a king abdicates the throne or crown.

I learned an important word: abdicate. To abdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usual y used when a king abdicates the throne or crown. Lesson learned too late: Delegate, but don't abdicate.

I get the constant priceless reminder that I have enough.
