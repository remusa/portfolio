I attended the first lecture of the freeOnlineCamp and Jovian.ml Pytorch Deep Learning certification
last Saturday. Our first assignment consisted of reading through Pytorch's documentation and
choosing five functions deemed useful.

I ended up choosing the following five:

<ul>
  <li>torch.cross()</li>
  <li>torch.flatten()</li>
  <li>torch.save()</li>
  <li>torch.load()</li>
  <li>torch.reshape()</li>
</ul>

Here's the Jupyter notebook I made for the assignment:
